I need to add another attempt to the conditional (`from collections import Generator as GeneratorType`), but since the only time this import would ever succeed is when `backports_abc` is present, I'd rather just do `from backports_abc import Generator`. \r\n\r\nIf this pattern were adopted by all users of `backports_abc`, the `patch()` function would become unnecessary (but could still be useful on py3.x, where it installs the ABCs where a backport-unaware caller would expect to find them).\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I would do something like this in `backports_abc.py` for each patchable type:\r\n```\r\ntry:\r\n    Generator = _collections_abc.Generator\r\nexcept AttributeError:\r\n    Generator = mk_gen()\r\n```",
