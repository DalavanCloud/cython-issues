I am guessing that this has to do with a conflict between the addition from Pull #1648 and one of the following lines in our header:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom libc.math cimport abs, fabs, sqrt\r\n\r\ncdef extern from \"<complex>\" namespace \"std\" nogil:\r\n    double cabs \"abs\" (double complex x)\r\n```\r\n\r\nas there was no issues with Cython version 0.25.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nPaul",

The issue does not show up in the current branch.  \r\n\r\nIn short, the older file was doing a cimport and an extern cdef for abs from two different sources.  Previous Cython versions obviously overlooked my stupidity.  So +1 for Cython 0.26.",
