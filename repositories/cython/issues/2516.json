    "body": "Looking at the documentation [Distributing Cython Modules](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/reference/compilation.html#distributing-cython-modules) and a very brief discussion on [cython-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cython-users/4HW3lTKeEsQ), it seems desirable to support a build workflow that is suitable for both invoking cythonize, as well as a simple build without running cythonize. This presumes that the source is shipped using both the cython files as well as the generated source.\r\n\r\nFrom the documentation ([Distributing Cython Modules](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/reference/compilation.html#distributing-cython-modules))\r\nit seems that to support this workflow, users need to have a rather intrusive changeset to their `setup.py`.\r\n\r\nI wanted to propose a build_ext command variant which is optimised for the non-cythonize workflow, and allows `setup.py` to be written as if it was to be built by a non cython `distutils`, and instead do some smart deduction of source discovery/replacement as a pre-build step.\r\n\r\nI've mocked up an example of such a build_ext which works this way here: https://github.com/eyakimov-bbg/python-testmodule/blob/cython_build_ext/setup.py\r\n\r\nIn theory this can be pulled in optionally by setuptools just like the old cython build_ext was, if it is implemented this way then the `setup.py` would not have any cython specific settings at all. Although having said that, being able to specify cythonize parameters in setup.py can be useful, but for this case I would suggest that build_ext command be explicitly set via setup.py's cmdclass property (perhaps conditionally on the presence of cython) with the cythonize parameters bound.\r\n\r\nIs this something that would be desirable for cython's build_ext?",
