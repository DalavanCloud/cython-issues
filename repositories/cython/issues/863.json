How can we define a generic rule in Cython which makes both possible?\n\nShould the behaviour of \"var.shape\" e.g. depend on the requested return value? This means overloading on return value which is a non-trivial language change, though perhaps appropriate here.\n\nThoughts welcome!\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/302",
