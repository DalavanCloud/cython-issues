The converters for builtin types are also employed for implementing the converters for typedef types. \n\nAbout (2): Nice tick! I am trying this, and it seems to work... Dag: Why do you say this complicates things? temp allocation of external typedefs uses the typedef cname, where is the complication here?\n\nAbout (3): AFAIK, some compilers can inline recursive functions up to some recursion depth (a depth of 1 would be enough for our case, right?). Not sure what GCC does here. However, if we can the change the implementation to a non-recursive one, I do not have any problem with that change.\n\nAbout (4): I agree, this has to improve (and change Pyx_PyNumber_Int accordingly). However, just FYI note that in Py>=2.6, PyInt_Check/PyLong_Check (and many other PyXXX_Check for builtin types) now use PyType_FastSubclass. Howerver, this relies on ob_type->tp_flags inheritance, which is tricky for C types... I know that this Py2.6 change caused some headaches to NumPy folks related to scalar types.",

What type should the temporary of the denominator be allocated as?\n\n(Yes, there's a problem even with size being unknown, but there's insentive to get that resolved at some point because delaying resolving the type until C compilation time has huge benefits. However I can't see any benefits to delaying whether a type is signed or not.)",
