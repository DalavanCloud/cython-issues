It does not help much since the distinct code paths for PyPy that it checks are rare, and I can see that it's outright dangerous in some cases.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit unsure regarding your actual question, because the function is definitely used for converting non-int/long object values to numbers. I'll have to take a look. It's part of the normal object to C number conversion.",

(Note that we'd still keep up the alternative implementations, in case users want to disable the low-level slot dependency.)\r\n\r\nI looked into the usage of the conversion function, and it's really intended to convert objects that support the number protocol and not anything else. It's used as a fallback for casting when the input object is not an int/long, or when the input value is very large (i.e. > long long). That actually makes it less important than it looks. I think the best place to work around this diversion in behaviour is the last fallback at the bottom of the `CIntFromPy` utility function in `TypeConversion.c`. We could explicitly exclude strings there if slots are not used. That's not time critical code anymore. In fact, I wonder if the conversion function is still relevant at all, given that it's only used in so few places...\r\n\r\nRegarding tests, I've extended the `int_float_builtins_as_casts_T400` test to include that code path.",
