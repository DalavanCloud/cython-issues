    "body": "In Python code, it's quite common to test for a name and conditionally import or redefine it, e.g.\n```\nif sys.version_info[0] >= 3:\n    from functools import reduce\n```\nor\n```\ntry:\n    reduce\nexcept NameError:\n    from functools import reduce\n```\nCython currently sees the import and defines the name as a \"pyglobal\", thus preventing it from being looked up as a builtin in the non-importing case.\n\nFixing this properly requires control flow analysis and position dependent declarations.\n\nA temporary work-around could simply look up the name in the builtins if the lookup in the module globals fails at runtime.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/691",
