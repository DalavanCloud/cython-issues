Thus I'm suggesting we handle this consistently with other potential arithmetic overflows. Code written with explicit C `ints` (in C or Cython) generally ignore or otherwise guard against values large enough to cause overflows of all kinds, which is why we don't infer variables used in arithmetic to be of integer types by default. \r\n\r\nIn context, expressions like `100 - abs(x)` behave very differently than had we used the Python builtin (which returns signed ints), so I think treating the result as an unsigned value is an incorrect optimization, and wrong for nearly all values of x rather than just one of them. \r\n\r\nThe `overflowcheck` directive should disallow this edge case with an OverflowError when enabled.
