That makes them behave identically to normal functions for bound/unbound method behavior, and also adds a `__defaults__` attribute. However checking the generated C code shows it's not actually used when actually calling the method. The reason is that Cython adds the values that are set directly into the argument unpacking code it generates. It shouldn't be difficult to make object arguments do a fast lookup on the tuple, but for C-converted arguments it'll need to store those elsewhere. Perhaps add a setter which converts the C args whenever `__defaults__` is set?",
