    "body": "The following patch allows you to pass in variables for the conditional compilation feature from distutils.  This allows you to do fairly complex autoconf-type checks from setup.py and pass the results in to the compiler.\n\nPart of this patch involves adding the CompilationOptions object to the Context object instead of passing the options around all over the place.\n\nAt 2009-06-01T19:46:47Z **ehuss** added attachment [cython-cond3](https://gist.github.com/d2e7e724ee44a780677577bde4520813)\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/323",
