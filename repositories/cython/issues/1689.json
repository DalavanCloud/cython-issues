    "body": "I ran into a very bizarre bug in some of my work where I pass a numpy recarray to a cython function that contains a string field. For some reason if the string field length contains a 9 and is greater than 9 (e.g 19, 29, 39, 49, 191, etc), I get an error that looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nValueError: Expected a dimension of size 39, got 9\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are a few exceptions. A length of 91 seems to be ok, but 919 throws an error. Here is a minimal example that demonstrates the issue with Cython 0.25.2:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\ncimport numpy as np\r\n\r\n\r\ndtype = [\r\n         ('f1', 'S39')\r\n        ]\r\n\r\na = np.recarray(1, dtype=dtype)\r\na[0] = tuple(['abcd',])\r\n\r\n\r\ncdef packed struct r_type:\r\n    char[39] f1\r\n\r\n\r\ndef test_struct(r_type[:] x):\r\n    return x[0].f1\r\n    \r\nprint test_struct(a)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny idea what could possibly be going on here?",
