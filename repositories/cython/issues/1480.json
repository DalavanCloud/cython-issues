    "body": "The documentation in [compilation.rst](../blob/master/docs/src/reference/compilation.rst#configuring-the-c-build) claims that\r\n\r\n```\r\ncythonize(extensions, include_path=[numpy.get_include()])\r\n```\r\n\r\nadds the numpy include path to the include file search path used by the compiler. This has been quoted many times and the documented feature is used by many packages, although with zero effect: `include_path` only adds to the search path used by Cython to find `pyx` and `pxd` files.\r\n\r\nSome alternative ways to address this:\r\n\r\n1. Change docs to match code by removing the misleading section.\r\n2. Change code to match docs by adding the feature. \r\n3. Change docs and code to use `cython(include_dirs=[])` as a way for globally specifying C include paths. \r\n4. Change it all to have `cython_include_dirs` and `c_include_dirs` (or path).\r\n\r\n3 has the benefit that code using `include_path` will continue to function as before (no effect on C include path), while making the feature people have obviously been expecting available. The term `include_dir` would then consistently (albeit not obviously) refer to the C includes and the term `include_path` to the Cython includes. \r\n",
