            "body": "**scoder** commented\n\nHere is a patch that simply replaces the range() loop by a while loop that does all counting in Python. It's a lot slower than the range() loop that way (almost 800 msecs for the above example). But it might be possible to optimise it by using a C long for the counter as long as we stay inside its value range. That should give us almost C-for-loop performance in the most common case.\n\nI'm not saying it's the best way of doing it, just that I tried and that I think it might be a good start. Also, there are different possibilities for the fallback code. We might create an xrange() at that point and iterate over that, or we might keep incrementing Python longs.",
