    "body": "Setuptools tries to import `Cython.Distutils.bdist_ext` to determine if Cython is available (cf https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/src/626b55107cf96e6872a859f5c759458b01907d26/setuptools/command/build_ext.py?at=default#build_ext.py-13). However, this method is unreliable: if Cython has been installed for the regular Python interpreter, but setup.py runs under the debug interpreter, importing `Cython.Distutils.bdist_ext` succeeds (because it involves only .py files), but importing `Cython.Compiler` fails (because there is no extension module for the debugging interpreter). This then causes errors when setuptools tries to use Cython.\n\n\nWould it be possible to import `Cython.Compiler` in `Cython.Distutils.bdist_ext`, so that it's assured that Cython is installed and working if the import of `build_ext` succeeds?\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/859",
