Since most of this can be automated, there should be a tool for it.\r\n\r\nA part of this is already implemented in the form of the [cython_freeze](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/0.27.3/bin/cython_freeze) tool and the [BuildExecutable](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/0.27.3/Cython/Build/BuildExecutable.py) helper. Stitching it together into an easy to use \"here's my code, drop the binary here\" tool should not be all too difficult. Also take a look at [Nuitka](https://github.com/kayhayen/Nuitka), which reportedly has a good way of dealing with this.",

            "body": "I've run into two major issues when trying to use Cython to take a python codebase and create a single binary, some of which I'm sure are due to gross ignorance on my part:\r\n\r\n1. As far as I know, there isn't such a thing as a package-aware c extension in python, so if you're, for example, running `cython_freeze` over the codebase of an application that contains multiple packages you need to include a step where you flatten that namespace. This isn't too hard to do in codebases that don't do much in `__init__.py` files for example, but is much more difficult to guarantee in the general case.\r\n\r\n2. Related to the above, it's difficult to account for third-party dependencies. They still need, in general, to be shipped alongside the executable. Py2exe has an extension that allows for python to load dynamic libs from a zipfile, and also the capability to pack that up into a single executable, I'm not aware of a working way to do that on systems other than windows.",
