    "body": "When using cython in c++ mode, and wrapping existing C++ code with\n\ncdef extern from <C++ header file>\n\ndefining functions or class methods with default values for some of their arguments fails.\n\nUnfortunately, this does not result in any error message while cythoning the pyx file, rather in the production of an incorrect C++ file that does not compile.\n\nEven if default parameter values are still not supported, cython should at least generate an error for them. Otherwise, understanding what is going on is actually quite difficult.\n\nAt least, until cython itself cannot be fixed, please provide a visible note about the fact that this is a known case where cython produces illegal code in the documentation.\n\nAs a hack, wrapping the function pretending that it is overloaded works (although it is extremely verbose for functions with a lot of parameters taking default values).\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/816",
