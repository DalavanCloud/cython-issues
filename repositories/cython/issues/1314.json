    "body": "It would be useful if there was a function that took a string of cython code, compiled it as a .pyx file, and then returned a live cython module. Now, cython.inline sort of does this, but it also preprocesses the code under the assumption that it is a function-level chunk, and then excutes this chunck, automagically fetching unbound variables from the invoking envirionment. \n\nWhile this is very handy in many applications, I would also find it useful at runtime compile many defs/cdefs/cpdefs at the same time, and manually control passing in/out data. The main use case would be using cython as a backend for dynamic code generation.\n\nFirst I tried to improve cython.inline to make this easier, but it felt like constructing a better screwdriver in order to hammer in a nail. Instead I wrote cython.compile_module (mostly reusing cython.inline) which just compiles a string as if it was a .pyx file, returning the module object. Patch attached.\n\nAt 2012-01-11T18:27:16Z **bfredl** added attachment [compile_module.patch](https://gist.github.com/0820b84a364a145ace57fc82dec6b0ef)\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/759",

(Not really a comment on this patch, more of a general rant kind of thing.)\n\nThat being said, I think this feature is generally a nice thing to have. Github is a better place to provide patches, though, as it simplifies comments and discussions on pull requests.",
