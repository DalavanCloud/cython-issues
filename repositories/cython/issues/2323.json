    "body": "When calling `cythonize`, you can pass a `build_dir`, which is where `.c` files will be emitted after cythonization. However, if the `module_list` contains absolute paths rather than relative ones, `build_dir` will have no effect because:\r\n\r\n1. The `c_file` ends up being set to [`os.path.join(build_dir, c_file)`](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/53b6f435151aa6094a202928cf0b1f648b98d2e3/Cython/Build/Dependencies.py#L967), but\r\n2. `c_file` was originally set to [`os.path.splitext(source)[0] + \".c\"`](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/53b6f435151aa6094a202928cf0b1f648b98d2e3/Cython/Build/Dependencies.py#L962),\r\n3. `source` is an absolute path (because that's what the user provided), and\r\n4. when joining paths, [any path before an absolute path is discarded](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join).\r\n\r\nSo, the `.c` file ends up in the same directory as the original source file regardless of the value of `build_dir`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the right resolution is, but I spent a while debugging the issue and thought it worth sharing. I think that, at the very least, it would be nice to warn the user when this situation occurs. One way to do that would be to compare `c_file` before and after [Dependencies.py#L967](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/53b6f435151aa6094a202928cf0b1f648b98d2e3/Cython/Build/Dependencies.py#L967) and if it did not change, raise a warning.",
