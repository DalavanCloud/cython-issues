    "body": "Inside the base directory `/home/antoine/arrow/python`, I have a `pyarrow` package containing Cython modules (`.pyx` and `.pxi` files, mostly) as well as generated C++ code (for example `pyarrow.lib.cpp` for the `lib.pyx` file).\r\n\r\nWhen `Cython.Coverage` encounters a line coming from a `.pxi`, it tries to find out the corresponding C file. Unfortunately by doing so, it ends up looking in the wrong directory. In my case, the `_find_dep_file_path` is called with e.g. `main_file=\"/home/antoine/arrow/python/pyarrow/pyarrow.lib.cpp\"` and `file_path=\"../../pyarrow/io.pxi\"`. Ideally it would return the actual location of `io.pxi`, i.e. `/home/antoine/arrow/python/pyarrow/io.pxi`. Unfortunately it returns `/home/antoine/arrow/pyarrow/io.pxi`, which doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n`\"../../pyarrow/io.pxi\"` is the relative path that Cython writes out in the generated C++ file. I don't know why it has two `..` components, perhaps because Cython builds in `build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.6`? Either way, the whole thing doesn't work.",
