I'll do my best to make them.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I have been reading this thread already: http://www.mail-archive.com/cython-dev@codespeak.net/msg06945.html but I think that many things have changed and been done since, so I'm asking again to avoid getting my pull requests rejected.",

            "body": "Well, yes, there is a long-standing issue: the separation between the \"users guide\" and the \"reference guide\", most importantly for the \"Language Basics\" and \"Extension Types\" chapters. Both sides are not entirely in sync, and there is no real reason why there needs to be a reference guide in the first place.\r\n\r\nThere are a few drawbacks: removing parts of the documentation will leave stale links on the web, and filling the users guide with additional information may actually make it more difficult for new users to understand. But the current duplication also makes it difficult for users to find what they are looking for, so I doubt that there is a big risk of making things worse.\r\n\r\nSo, I can't say if this is a task that you would consider. It's definitely not a small task, but it's something that can be done incrementally, one thing at a time. In the end, I'd be happy if the reference guide pages were reduced to a simple placeholder link back to the respective users guide page that replaces them.\r\n\r\nWould that be something you'd want to try?",
