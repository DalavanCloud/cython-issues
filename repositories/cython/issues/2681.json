The code [in the setup.py file](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/setup.py#L111) is checking the sysconfig for include files, but it also needs to get the other compiler option flags.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this: we're building Python with a 64-bit memory model on Solaris and other non-Linux operating systems. The native Solaris compiler defaults to a 32-bit memory model, so building Cython from the source distro fails out of the box. We then need to work around this in our build systems. This effort increases when tools like tox get in the mix.",
