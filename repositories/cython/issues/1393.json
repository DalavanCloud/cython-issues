The offending line is clearly unsafe:\n```\n            g = gzip_open(fingerprint_file, 'wb')\n            try:\n                shutil.copyfileobj(f, g)\n            finally:\n                g.close()\n```\nIMHO cached files must always be changed atomically. That is, write to a temporary file in the same filesystem (usually: same directory) and then rename it. NFS probably exacerbates the issue but it is a race condition even without it.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/837",
