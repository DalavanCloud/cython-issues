When I compile cython in MacOS, the compiled `so` file has extension `cpython-36m-darwin.so` and break the script. \r\nThe following code fixed the problem:\r\n```\r\n+ \"\"\" && python -c 'import os, sys, glob; n = len(sys.argv); find_so_file = lambda src: glob.glob(\"{}*so\".format(src.split(\".\")[0]))[0]; [os.rename(find_so_file(src), dst) for src, dst in zip(sys.argv[1:], sys.argv[1+n//2:])]' $(SRCS) $(OUTS)\"\"\",\r\n```\r\n",
