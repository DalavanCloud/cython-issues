    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nIs there any way to have a Cython module compatible with both Python 2 and 3? I am aware that the generated .c file can be linked to either python27.dll or python3.dll. But what I am looking is that a way to allow the compiled .pyd to be able to load in both python 2 and 3. Any help is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nI also noticed this comment \"We are also working to make the compiler run in both Python 2.x and 3.x.\" on the following page. I am wondering if it is related to my needs somehow.\r\n\r\nhttp://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/pyrex_differences.html\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMayank",
