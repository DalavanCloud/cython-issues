    "body": "As the builtin/\"utility code\" types of Cython becomes more complex, the current way of building up the output is too naive. Current behaviour:\n\n * Output stream is divided into coarse-grained blocks\n * Within each block, the order of type declarations are relied upon\n\nFor complex numbers, memoryviews, etc., this is ugly or even insufficient. It would be better to store the full type DAG, and walk it to output declarations in the right order.\n\nUtility code could make use of the same DAG, so that utility code could depend on types and vice versa.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/469",
