I suggest you do the same, if possible...",

So it seems that this feature does not currently work with such a fake anonymous struct declarations, simply because it relies on a correct declaration. But the struct declaration itself should otherwise work ok.\r\n\r\nThe way out of this for us is that we'll eventually have to support anonymous sub-structs in Cython. Until then, I don't see a way to use those two features together.",
