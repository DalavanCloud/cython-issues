    "body": "This snippet from CPython's ```test_types.py``` crashes during type inference in ```AttributeNode```:\n\n```\nf = 1.1234e90\nresult = f.__format__('f')\n```\n\nThe problem is that the ```AttributeNode``` tries to coerce the number to a Python object, but the ```NameNode``` doesn't know its type yet. So it crashes with\n```\n  File \"Cython/Compiler/ExprNodes.py\", line 601, in coerce_to\n    src_is_py_type = src_type.is_pyobject\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'is_pyobject'\n```\n\nIn general, type inference shouldn't have this kind of side effect.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/762",
