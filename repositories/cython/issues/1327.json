However, then smid - x should be printed as 4294967292.\n\nEither way, note that this behavior causes the fully optimized example on:\nhttp://docs.cython.org/src/tutorial/numpy.html\nto break. Presumably this example worked with older cython versions.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/772",

Mixing signed and unsigned integer types is worth the C compiler warning that this code gives me, and using unsigned values to subtract them from signed values mostly screams for trouble. That fact that you seem to have misinterpreted the (certainly non-ovious) result speaks volumes, I think.",
