    "body": "The documentation for **Conditional Compilation** references the source of basic defined variables such as \"UNAME_SYSNAME\" and others using the following phrasing:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncorresponding to the values returned by :func:`os.uname`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is technically incorrect because the actual [source of these variables](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/cb511f978f8319d15a6552bcc6c0390123804b19/Cython/Compiler/Scanning.py#L107) in Cython is `platform.uname()`, but the serious problem is that `os.uname` does not even exist on the Windows platform. This makes it difficult for new users to understand what to expect when using **Conditional Compilation** if they are developing on Windows. \r\n\r\nI recommend updating the source of the documentation to reflect this. I am new to this community and not certain of the pull request rules (especially regarding documentation), so I have not yet prepared a pull request.",
