    "body": "I'm trying to figure out how to use cygdb to debug extensions built with python 3. I've tested all the debugger commands listed in http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/debugging.html when debugging python 2 extensions and everything works great. But some of the commands seem to be broken when debugging python 3 extensions.\n\nHere are the debugger commands that I've confirmed as working with python 3 extensions:\n\ncy break\ncy step\ncy next\ncy run\ncy cont\ncy down\ncy finish .. works but prints error message\ncy exec\ncy list\ncy_lineno()\ncy_eval()\ncy_cname()\n\nHere are the commands which fail under python 3, and the error message that is given for each:\n\ncy up\n    Python Exception <class 'gdb.error'> There is no member named length.:\n    Error occurred in Python command: There is no member named length.\ncy finish .. works but gives error\n    Python Exception <class 'gdb.error'> There is no member named length.:\n    Error occurred in Python command: There is no member named length.\ncy bt\n    Python Exception <class 'gdb.error'> There is no member named length.:\n    Error occurred in Python command: There is no member named length.\ncy print\n    Python Exception <class 'gdb.error'> There is no member named ma_mask.:\n    Python Exception <class 'gdb.error'> Error occurred in Python command: There is no member named ma_mask.:\n    Error occurred in Python command: Error occurred in Python command: There is no member named ma_mask.\ncy set x = 2\n    Python Exception <class 'gdb.error'> No symbol \"__pyx_v_10helloworld_x\" in current context.:\n    Error occurred in Python command: No symbol \"__pyx_v_10helloworld_x\" in current context.\ncy locals\n    Python Exception <class 'gdb.error'> There is no member named ma_mask.:\n    Error occurred in Python command: There is no member named ma_mask.\ncy globals\n    Python Exception <class 'gdb.error'> There is no member named ma_mask.:\n    Error occurred in Python command: There is no member named ma_mask.\ncy_cvalue()\n    Python Exception <class 'gdb.error'> There is no member named ma_mask.:\n    Error occurred in Python convenience function: There is no member named ma_mask.\n\nIn summary:\n  - The \"cy set\" and \"cy_cname()\" commands seem to be giving incorrect C names for cython variables. I did a grep of the generated .c source file for \"__pyx_v_10helloworld_x\", and didn't get any hits. Luckily, the \"cy exec\" command works, so I can use that to get the value of variables as a workaround. \n  - Any commands related to viewing or traversing the call stack seem to give an error related to a missing \"length\" member. \n  - Commands related to printing the value of a variable complain about a missing \"ma_mask\" member. \n\nHere are the source files I used for the test:\n\nhelloworld.py:\nimport helloworld\n\nhelloworld.pyx:\nx = 1\ny = \"a\"\nprint(\"Hello World 1\")\nprint(\"Hello World 2\")\nprint(\"Hello World 3\")\nprint(\"Hello World 4\")\nprint(\"Hello World 5\")\nprint(\"Hello World 6\")\nprint(\"Hello World 8\")\nprint(\"Hello World 9\")\nprint(\"Hello World 10\")\n\nsetup.py:\nfrom distutils.core import setup\nfrom Cython.Build import cythonize\nfrom distutils.extension import Extension\nextensions = [[\"helloworld.pyx\"](Extension(\"helloworld\",))]\nsetup(ext_modules=cythonize(extensions, gdb_debug=True, output_dir=\".\"))\n\nTo compile I ran:\npython setup.py build_ext --inplace\n\nTo debug, I ran:\ncygdb -vv . -- --args python helloworld.py\n\nHere is my python version:\nPython 3.4.2\n\nI used pyenv (https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) to build and install the latest Python 3 version with debugging symbols enabled.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/840",
