A dedicated transform would be good for this. It could either replace expressions with their constant result node (e.g. with an ```IntNode``` of the result type), or it could at least add a ```const_result``` attribute to each ```ExprNode``` that would either be None (no constant result) or hold a tuple (result_type, Python value). A tuple is better than a plain value here, as None is a valid result value. Maybe a mixture of both approaches is doable. The code generation phase could then check directly if a node has a constant value and decide if it can generate optimal code for the constant case.",

The ```constant_result``` attribute is initially set to ```ExprNodes.constant_value_not_set``` and the transform replaces it by either ```ExprNodes.not_a_constant``` or the constant result of the subexpression. The code generation phase (or intermediate transforms) can then use that result instead of generating code for the original subexpression.\n\nThe transform does not currently replace nodes by a constant node, this would require:\n- a mapping from the C result type (pyrex type) to an ```ExprNode``` that can represent this value\n- a way to initialise this node after the type analysis phase, including things like cached constant values for integers etc.",
