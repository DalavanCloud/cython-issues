NumPy defines [`NPY_PREFETCH`]( https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/v1.15.0/numpy/core/include/numpy/npy_common.h#L89-L102 ), which could be a useful model to build a cross platform, cross compiler `__builtin_prefetch`. Could also just `extern` NumPy's implementation.",

            "body": "In theory, yes, would be nice. In practice, the question is where to add it (or, more specifically, where to expose it for Cython users). I don't really see a place where this would fit into the `Cython/Includes/` library hierarchy. And it doesn't really seem important enough to make it a language feature, nor even just to add it to the `cython.*` namespace as a function. So, if you could come up with a reasonable proposal for that â€¦\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd prefer adding \"something like\" the numpy implementation, to avoid having to add NumPy's BSD license to Cython's list of licenses just for this snippet.\r\n\r\nOne little bummer is that code like `prefetch(some-expression)` is actually misleading, because `some-expression` is not necessarily evaluated at this point, e.g. in a loop. That might have an impact on Cython's control flow analysis.",
