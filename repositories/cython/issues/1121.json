    "body": "I found (and, I think, fixed) a major performance bug with special functions in Cython.\n\nIf you define a special function (```__len__```, ```__add__```, ```__getattr__```, etc.) in a cdef class, and then inherit from that class with a non-cdef class (either a Cython class that's not cdef, or a Python class), then calling the special function on the subclass will be vastly slower than necessary.\n\nFor example, with this Cython code:\n```\ncdef class NullAdder:\n    def __add__(self, other):\n        return self\n\nclass NullAdder2(NullAdder):\n    pass\n```\nI get these timings:\n```\nsage: na = NullAdder()\nsage: timeit('na + na', number=10^5, repeat=30)\n100000 loops, best of 30: 94.3 ns per loop\nsage: na2 = NullAdder2()\nsage: timeit('na2 + na2', number=10^5, repeat=30)\n100000 loops, best of 30: 261 ns per loop\n```\nwhere it takes about 170ns extra to call the method in the subclass.  (The overhead differs by special function; for ```__getattr__``` it's more like 700ns of overhead on the same machine.)\n\nAfter my patch, the timings become:\n```\nsage: na = NullAdder()\nsage: timeit('na + na', number=10^5, repeat=30)\n100000 loops, best of 30: 92 ns per loop\nsage: na2 = NullAdder2()\nsage: timeit('na2 + na2', number=10^5, repeat=30)\n100000 loops, best of 30: 92.9 ns per loop\n```\nThat is, to within measurement error, the special function on the subclass is exactly the same speed as the special function on the superclass.\n\nWhat's going on (described in terms of ```__getattr__```/.tp_getattro, but the same thing happens for any special function):\n\nIn typeobject.c, there's a subtle interplay between the contents of\nthe .tp_getattro slot and the \"```__getattr__```\" in the type's dictionary,\nto make sure they always match.  When defining a type in C, you can\nset .tp_getattro, and typeobject.c:add_operators() will create a\n\"```__getattr__```\" containing a wrapper for the .tp_getattro function.\nWhen defining a type in Python, you can set ```__getattr__```, and\ntypeobject.c:update_one_slot() will set .tp_getattro to a function\nthat will look up ```__getattr__``` and call it.\n\nIf you define a type in C, that sets .tp_getattro (so add_operators()\ncreates a ```__getattr__``` wrapper), and then inherit from the type in\nPython, it needs to avoid setting .tp_getattro to the function that\nlooks up ```__getattr__```; instead, it should leave .tp_getattro alone\n(inherited from its parent).  This case is detected in\nupdate_one_slot() by checking if ```__getattr__``` is a wrapper object; if\nso, it was presumably created by add_operators(), and presumably\nmatches .tp_getattro, so nothing has to be done.\n\nCython was breaking this optimization by setting both .tp_getattro and\n```__getattr__```.  Then update_one_slot() notices that ```__getattr__``` is set,\nand is not a wrapper object; so it sets .tp_getattro to call\n```__getattr__```.\n\nThe fix is simple... just don't create the Python versions of the methods and let ```PyType_Ready``` (which calls add_operators()) do it for you.\n\nI do know of one behavioral change with this patch: if you define ```__getattr__``` in a cdef class, then Python introspection will claim that you implemented ```__getattribute__``` instead.  (There may be other similar changes.)\n\nI tested the patch as follows: applied it to Cython 0.12.1, Cython 0.13.beta0, and current cython-devel; and ran the test suite.  All tests passed (except the two failures reported by Arfrever for Cython 0.13.beta0).  I then applied it to the Sage Cython spkg from Sage 4.5.1, rebuilt Sage's cython code using the new version (\"sage -ba\"), and ran the entire test suite (\"make ptestlong\").  All tests passed.\n\nI'm not sure if it's too late, but I think this patch (or something like it) should be seriously considered for 0.13.\n\nAt 2010-07-27T06:20:14Z @cwitty added attachment [trac_561-cython-special-functions.patch](https://gist.github.com/b9d73cd92809a1b8a440aecf257ffda8)\n\nAt 2010-07-28T01:02:24Z @cwitty added attachment [trac_561-test-suite.patch](https://gist.github.com/f62d71d47a3f30ef78b3ea693ede817f)\n\nAt 2010-08-12T18:00:20Z @cwitty added attachment [trac_561-python3-doctest-fixes.patch](https://gist.github.com/e6eaf52862b64df82ab024498151e2ff)\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/561",
