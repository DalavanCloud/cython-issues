The C compiler might be able to remove them in many cases, but there should still be a separate pass that removes the redundant checks right before the code generation phase.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/268",

This can be extended to include value ranges found by a future control flow analysis step. For now, it avoids truly redundant checks effectively.",
