See https://groups.google.com/d/msg/cython-users/j58Sp3QMrD4/y9vJy9YBi_kJ  The bug was fixed and code like that worked through Cython 0.25.2.  I just tried Cython 0.26.1 and the bug has reappeared.\r\n\r\nAs before, the workaround is to upgrade the reference parameter to a full pointer then dereference it:\r\n\r\n    cdef void foo(double& out):\r\n        (&out)[0] = 123",
