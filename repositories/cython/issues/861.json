    "body": "Currently, buffers are acquired/released through somewhat of a hack: There's code in ```NameNode``` to \"manually\" track assignments to buffered-type local variables and do the right thing when they are reassigned.\n\nThis means that it is not possible to do e.g.\n```\nprint (<object[int]>myobj)[3]\n```\nas there wouldn't be a local variable for the buffer.\n\nThe proper way of doing this is moving buffer acquisition and release over to the existing Cython coercion system (which is used for coercing C ints to Python ints and so on), and insert a CoercionNode in situations like above.\n\nThis requires http://trac.cython.org/ticket/299 to be done first, as a coercion node requires a temporary result, neatly packed in a single variable.\n\nWhen http://trac.cython.org/ticket/177 is done, this will also be what enables\n```\nsome_cdef_func(python_object)\n```\ni.e. without explicitly acquiring the buffer.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/300",
