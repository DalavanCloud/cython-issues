When the bufinfo refcount hits 0, one would release the buffer.\n\n'''Note 2'''\nFurthermore, doing efficient slicing (http://trac.cython.org/ticket/178) requires moving the base pointer. E.g. with ```arr[10:]``` the strides are not affected, only the base pointer. This might be an argument in favor of storing the buffer pointer itself by value, making it\n```\ntypedef struct {\n  __Pyx_buffer* bufinfo;\n  char* data;\n  Py_ssize_t shape0, stride0;\n} __Pyx_StridedBuf_1D;\n```\n\n'''Note 3'''\nFinally, I'm not sure how much of an issue it is to have some unecessarry fields here and there.
