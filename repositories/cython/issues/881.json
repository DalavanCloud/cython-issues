I suppose it wouldn't be very difficult to do:\n\n1) Have a directory structure with py and pyx and various configuration files in it\n\n2) Have a test script which just copies this whole directory and then runs doctest on test_*.py in the directory (each probably in a new Python instance, to get pyximport and pyx modules loaded/unloaded).\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/321",
