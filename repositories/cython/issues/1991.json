Could you consider changing your internals to pave the way for a future switch to LLVM? I feel like the hardest part would be handling C interoperability, but LLVM makes this somewhat elegant. You could still emit everything directly in pure-python code since Numba has already created the excellent [llvmlite](https://github.com/numba/llvmlite) bindings.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of this change could be enormous, not only for performance and compilation speed but for the quality of the generated code and the build system.\r\nI hope you consider this to help move past the limitations of using C as an intermediate representation!\r\n\r\nThanks for your time,\r\n\\- Techcable",

If someone implements this, and proves along the way that it's worth doing, then I doubt that we'd reject the pull requests for it.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's not obvious to me that such an approach *has* advantages. I consider C (and C++) an excellent language target that results in a very high portability. It makes it rather easy for developers to ship the generated C code to their users and have them compile it on their side with pretty much any C compiler. Restricting that to LLVM would in fact *reduce* the wideness of Cython's applicability.\r\n\r\nCould you elaborate what benefits you expect from targeting LLVM specifically instead of generic C?\r\n",
