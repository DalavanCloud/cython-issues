It mainly changes the way offsets are calculated, which is one big formula generated by the memoryviews code. PR welcome, but we might have to hide the support behind an explicit option somehow, depending on how well the C compiler can deal with it. We might have to try and benchmark different options, maybe also something like `likely(!suboffsets) ? (simple calculation) : (complex calculation)`. But first get it right, then make it fast.",
