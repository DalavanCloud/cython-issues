The pitfalls are no more or different than what one encounters in C, and inconsistency is probably worse than unintuitive behavior. Imagine\n\n```\ncdef unsigned int i = 10\nprint -i, i, -i < i\n```\nwhich would give (were we to change Cython's interpretation)\n```\n-10 10 False\n```\n\nPlaying around with this will possibly mess up anyone trying to do bit-fiddling and stuff too. Anyone using unsigned types has to explicitly declare them as such, and there's little benifit to using them most of the time. They are better thought of as arithmatic mod ```2^n``` for some n. There should probably be a big warning in the section on numpy indexing about the pitfals of using unsigned types. \n\nI would mark this as invalid. ",
