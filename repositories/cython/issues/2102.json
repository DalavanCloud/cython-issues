An issue for this topic generally is here: https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/8242\r\n\r\nOne important issue that came up from @mingwandroid relates to Cython, see https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/8242#issuecomment-359524128\r\n\r\n> It seems the shared libraries are chock full of instruction code\r\n\r\n> PyInit_cython_special is huge; more than 1MB.\r\n\r\n> why all of these movq instructions are not being coalesced into a memset.\r\n\r\nIn a separate conversation he said the following:\r\n\r\n> Now ideally you'd like your compiler to be smart enough to coalesce all those clears over the whole object into 1 memset, and then even better, put them all together so that a single memset could do it.\r\n> the package size on disk is swamped by the instructions to do these clears!\r\n> instead of a call to a function to memset it's a huge amount of instructions, like tens of thousands.\r\n> and that takes space on the extension module text segment.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I don't have much expertise here, but I thought I'd raise an issue here in case this sort of problem can be resolved within Cython, or, if not, if anyone here has any additional helpful thoughts. \r\n\r\nThank you all for your time.",

            "body": "Thanks for bringing this up. As a quick improvement, I enabled `-Os` (optimise for size instead of speed) only for the module init function, and only under gcc for now. For a couple of arbitrarily chosen, -O3 compiled and stripped .py modules, the total .so file size reduction that I could see was 0-3%. So, not useless, but also not impressive. More of a \"no reason not to do it\" kind of improvement. You can add `-DCYTHON_SMALL_CODE=` to your CFLAGS to disable it and see the difference.\r\n\r\nI can't say without further investigation what all those `movq` commands do, but the module init function does a lot of initialisations of various objects, variables and structures. Probably worth taking a look, but it's not necessarily just \"stupid code\". The C code is most likely easier to analyse than the assembly.",

The default compilation triggered by `python setup.py develop` yields a total of 35MB worth of SO files and with those flags the total size is 5MB.\r\n\r\nFor scikit-image the savings are similarly dramatic. Including debug symbols and using `-O3` instead of `-Os` the total size of all SOs is 58MB, with the above flags the total size is 7.3MB which is a savings of about 8x.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why the default flag of `-g` is included in C extensions, but this isn't a Cython issue per se. We should think about solving this issue for everyone and potentially changing the default, or at least providing a way to easily configure these flags for more complex distutils/setuptools setups (like scikit-image and scikit-learn)",

So it's definitely the case that stripping removed the lion's share of the bulk. There are really two issues here: 1) it's unclear why the ecosystem at large doesn't ship their compiled libraries stripped, and 2) whether optimizing for size is something cython should handle. IMO both should be handled by library authors. Potentially there should be a flag for release and debug modes that is extensible so that folks can customize compiler and linker flags.
