An issue for this topic generally is here: https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/8242\r\n\r\nOne important issue that came up from @mingwandroid relates to Cython, see https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/8242#issuecomment-359524128\r\n\r\n> It seems the shared libraries are chock full of instruction code\r\n\r\n> PyInit_cython_special is huge; more than 1MB.\r\n\r\n> why all of these movq instructions are not being coalesced into a memset.\r\n\r\nIn a separate conversation he said the following:\r\n\r\n> Now ideally you'd like your compiler to be smart enough to coalesce all those clears over the whole object into 1 memset, and then even better, put them all together so that a single memset could do it.\r\n> the package size on disk is swamped by the instructions to do these clears!\r\n> instead of a call to a function to memset it's a huge amount of instructions, like tens of thousands.\r\n> and that takes space on the extension module text segment.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I don't have much expertise here, but I thought I'd raise an issue here in case this sort of problem can be resolved within Cython, or, if not, if anyone here has any additional helpful thoughts. \r\n\r\nThank you all for your time.",

            "body": "Thanks for bringing this up. As a quick improvement, I enabled `-Os` (optimise for size instead of speed) only for the module init function, and only under gcc for now. For a couple of arbitrarily chosen, -O3 compiled and stripped .py modules, the total .so file size reduction that I could see was 0-3%. So, not useless, but also not impressive. More of a \"no reason not to do it\" kind of improvement. You can add `-DCYTHON_SMALL_CODE=` to your CFLAGS to disable it and see the difference.\r\n\r\nI can't say without further investigation what all those `movq` commands do, but the module init function does a lot of initialisations of various objects, variables and structures. Probably worth taking a look, but it's not necessarily just \"stupid code\". The C code is most likely easier to analyse than the assembly.",
