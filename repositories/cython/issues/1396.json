    "body": "I'm trying to write a cython script using language_level 3 that uses .pxd files from the pysam library (https://code.google.com/p/pysam/). The .pxd files are written using language_level 2. Unfortunately, the author has not added explicit language_level declations to the .pxd files. Because cimported .pxd files inherit the language_level from the parent file unless explicitly set in the .pxd file, I am getting compile errors when cimporting them:\n\n```\nError compiling Cython file:\n------------------------------------------------------------\n...\nfrom libc.stdint cimport uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t\nfrom libc.stdlib cimport malloc, calloc, realloc, free\nfrom libc.string cimport memcpy, memcmp, strncpy, strlen, strdup\nfrom libc.stdio cimport FILE, printf\n\nfrom cfaidx cimport faidx_t, Fastafile\n^\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n/users/bbooth/.pyenv/skittles/versions/3.4.2-debug/lib/python3.4/site-packages/pysam/calignmentfile.pxd:7:0: 'cfaidx.pxd' not found\n```\n\nThe pysam .pxd files are using python 2 style relative imports, which don't work in language_level 3 mode. It would be great in these cases if there was some way to locally set the language_level for cimported files, such as:\n\n```\ncimport cython\nwith cython.language_level(2):\n    cimport pysam.calignmentfile\n```\n\nI know the library author should be responsible for explicitly setting the language_level in the .pxd files, but in cases where they haven't done so, it is painful for the consumer of these libraries to deal with this problem. I have already filed a bug report with the library author, but I have no idea how long it will take for it to be fixed. It would be helpful if there was some way to set the default language_level for cimported files if no language_level declaration exists in the .pxd file. \n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/841",
