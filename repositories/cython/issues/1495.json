It's perhaps fine for demonstration purposes as it's understandable what's going on, but should be very clearly recommended against for production purposes.  The docs should instead recommend using the correct `build_ext` command.  I don't think this should be done automatically--I think the onus is on the author of software using Cython to write their `setup.py` correctly.\r\n\r\nsetuptools does have a thing where if Cython is detected it replaces its build_ext command with the one from Cython automatically.
