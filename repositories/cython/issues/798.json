This means that Cython 0.11.x stays broken for large constants (with or without constant folding).\n\nThe reason is that it would require a rather critical backport of the constant folding refactoring to enable the constant caching (```__pyx_int_12345```) for calculated values. And still, this only solves the problem for Python values. C values are still affected (although I consider that less critical as users have to care about large constants in C code anyway: they are not necessarily portable).",
