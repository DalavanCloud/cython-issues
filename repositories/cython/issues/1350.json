    "body": "In Cython 0.17.2, the following\n```\ncdef class Foo:\n    cpdef inline bar(self):\n        pass\n```\nfails to compile with an ''Only final types can have final Python (def/cpdef) methods'' error.\n\nTicket http://trac.cython.org/ticket/586: ''Support \"final\" methods in non-final cdef classes'' suggests that this should work, though. Said ticket also implemented an ''Overriding final methods is not allowed'' error which would be the expected result if one were to override a final method.\n\nRobert Bradshaw wrote (https://groups.google.com/d/msg/cython-users/UuQvpvdNhjc/DILSEQvOun4J): The issue is how to prevent them from being overridden in Python (which is not unsolveable, could probably be done pretty easily with a metaclass). It's intentional that we disallow it before such a mechanism is in place\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/795",
