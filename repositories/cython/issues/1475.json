    "body": "I was experimenting with writing a python wrapper for the C `libsox` library where the developers seem to use the convention of placing the `const` keyword _after_ the c type e.g.,\r\n\r\n    sox_bool\r\n    LSX_API\r\n    sox_is_playlist(\r\n    LSX_PARAM_IN_Z char const * filename \r\n    );\r\n\r\nHowever, Cython raised a syntax error when trying to compile this. Switching the order of `char` and `const` in the above example lets Cython compile successfully.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, the order of `char` and `const` is interchangeable in C. So is this a Cython bug? Or is this mentioned somewhere in the Cython documentation as known limitation? Because I couldn't find any mention of it.\r\n\r\nThis is verbatim the question I posted on stack overflow:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/39690481/position-of-const-in-declarations-matters?noredirect=1#comment66690601_39690481\r\n",
