I also thought about a \"NoneCheckNode\" when I wrote this.\nThat would be a very simple and explicit thing, and also very easy to\nhandle (or optimise away) in later transformations and during code generation.\n\nA PythonApiCall node might be a good idea (needs some more thinking) and\nwould relieve us from having to generate all sorts of Entry's & friends.\n\n>> Some of the resulting operations could warrant their own node\n\nYes, I gave an example with the int vs. None return value. There's also the\nissue that many methods of builtins have their own specific exceptions when\npassing None values. This needs to be handled, and a PythonApiCall node\nwould be a good place to do it.\n```",
