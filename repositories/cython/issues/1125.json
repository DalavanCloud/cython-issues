That way, we could simply intercept the dispatchers in these classes and check if the optimisation was explicitly disabled. We could also support wildcards like \"list.*\".\n\nMost of the \"feature implementations\" that currently live in ```Optimize.py``` are just special cases of unimplemented features (e.g. ```all(genexp)``` while lacking generator expressions in general). Or think of slicing pointers, which doesn't work anywhere outside of iteration (see e.g. the carray iteration transform method). It's clear that these things break the compilation when being disabled, so we might want to exclude them from the enable/disable mechanism.",
