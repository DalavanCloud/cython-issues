    "body": "To achieve Python semantics, Cython has to add a number of runtime checks around arithmetic operations in order to trap division by zero errors or integer range overflows. It should be a lot faster to trap SIGFPE instead, as this would only impact the error case, not the normal case.\n\nOpen issues:\n\n * how to make sure we continue safely at the correct error label after catching a signal?\n * how to do this in a portable way?\n\nA hybrid solution that uses signals if available on a platform might also work.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/282",
