The right fix is to prevent temp variables from becoming visible to user code in the first place. The reason for the crash is that Cython is trying to put the allocated temp variables into the module dict - clearly the wrong thing to do.\n\nPossible approach to fix this: create a fake Entry for temp variables at the global level that is basically declared cdef, but without an assigned type, so that type inference can still work.\n\nPlaces to fix: look for usages of ```TemplateTransform.temp_name_counter``` in ```TreeFragment.py``` and ```ParseTreeTransforms.py```.\n\nIncreasing priority as this leads to user visible broken behaviour.",
