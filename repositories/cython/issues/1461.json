The whole tracing support works by explicitly calling the tracer before the C code that is generated for each line of user code that gets executed, and declarations aren't really considered user code. The trace call would need to get added to the instantiation of class objects and functions. AFAIR, we already trace the user code in the module init function, so this should generally be possible, although some C things might happen in an unexpected order in Cython.\n",
