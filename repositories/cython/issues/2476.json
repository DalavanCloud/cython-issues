There is a project I am working on and it compiles using Python 2.7.14 without problem. When I compile it using Stackless Python 2.7.14 I get a Python app crash as soon as it starts cythonizing.\r\n\r\nHere is the data from the app crash window\r\n\r\n    Problem Event Name:\tAPPCRASH\r\n    Application Name:\tpython.exe\r\n    Application Version:\t0.0.0.0\r\n    Application Timestamp:\t59ccecdf\r\n    Fault Module Name:\tpython27.dll\r\n    Fault Module Version:\t2.7.14150.1013\r\n    Fault Module Timestamp:\t59ccecce\r\n    Exception Code:\tc0000005\r\n    Exception Offset:\t00069c2a\r\n    OS Version:\t6.1.7601.2.1.0.256.1\r\n    Locale ID:\t1033\r\n    Additional Information 1:\t0a9e\r\n    Additional Information 2:\t0a9e372d3b4ad19135b953a78882e789\r\n    Additional Information 3:\t0a9e\r\n    Additional Information 4:\t0a9e372d3b4ad19135b953a78882e789\r\n\r\nI am building python_openzwave (updated version that will build on Windows) and I am more then happy to provide the code and requirements to build it if it is needed to do some testing. I think that because it builds properly without Stackless that there is some kind of a compatibility issue with Stackless. The project I am working on has been around since 1996 and unfortunately Stackless Python is not something that can be removed and the version of python can not be upgraded at the present time.\r\n\r\nI searched the internet to see if anyone has had an issue with the 2 working together and I could not find any issues. I couldn't find anything on someone running the 2 together either. Pretty much a dead end.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.\r\nThanks again.\r\nKevin\r\n\r\n",
