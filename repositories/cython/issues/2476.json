There is a project I am working on and it compiles using Python 2.7.14 without problem. When I compile it using Stackless Python 2.7.14 I get a Python app crash as soon as it starts cythonizing.\r\n\r\nHere is the data from the app crash window\r\n\r\n    Problem Event Name:\tAPPCRASH\r\n    Application Name:\tpython.exe\r\n    Application Version:\t0.0.0.0\r\n    Application Timestamp:\t59ccecdf\r\n    Fault Module Name:\tpython27.dll\r\n    Fault Module Version:\t2.7.14150.1013\r\n    Fault Module Timestamp:\t59ccecce\r\n    Exception Code:\tc0000005\r\n    Exception Offset:\t00069c2a\r\n    OS Version:\t6.1.7601.2.1.0.256.1\r\n    Locale ID:\t1033\r\n    Additional Information 1:\t0a9e\r\n    Additional Information 2:\t0a9e372d3b4ad19135b953a78882e789\r\n    Additional Information 3:\t0a9e\r\n    Additional Information 4:\t0a9e372d3b4ad19135b953a78882e789\r\n\r\nI am building python_openzwave (updated version that will build on Windows) and I am more then happy to provide the code and requirements to build it if it is needed to do some testing. I think that because it builds properly without Stackless that there is some kind of a compatibility issue with Stackless. The project I am working on has been around since 1996 and unfortunately Stackless Python is not something that can be removed and the version of python can not be upgraded at the present time.\r\n\r\nI searched the internet to see if anyone has had an issue with the 2 working together and I could not find any issues. I couldn't find anything on someone running the 2 together either. Pretty much a dead end.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.\r\nThanks again.\r\nKevin\r\n\r\n",

I am not sure if you accounted for this. I do not know the file structure of Stackless 3+ and if this same thing needs to be accounted for.\r\n\r\nWould you happen to be able to provide me with the error output for the travis builds for 2.7 I think i may ask some questions over in the stackless repo.

This problem actually still did exist even tho I did manage to get Cython to compile  my code it was still throwing a strange exception \"SystemError no exception set\" upon importing the file. the folks over at stackless have spent quite a bit of time locating and repairing the issue. I wanted to note it here so that if someone else runs across this problem it has been documented. It appears as this problem might also affect stackless python 3 versions as well. \r\n\r\na more detailed description of the cause and solution can be found here\r\nhttps://github.com/stackless-dev/stackless/issues/166\r\nas well as in the referenced issue several posts back.\r\n\r\nI want to thank @scoder for adding stackless to the travis tests. it provided information that may have aided in a quick repair of the problem.
