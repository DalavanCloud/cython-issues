In the hypothetical future version of Cython that\nallows overriding ```__new__```, say that the overrides have to be declared\nin the .pxd file, with\n\n```\n   cdef TYPE __new__(self, foo, bar)\n```\n\n(where TYPE defaults to the class being declared, if omitted).  So\nwhen generating code, if the class doesn't override ```__new__```, you know\nthat calling the class returns an instance; if the class does override\n```__new__```, then the return type is explicitly given.  This could be a\nparent class, for my use case where I want to return an instance of a\nsibling class; or it could be \"object\", if anybody ever has a use case\nfor having ```__new__``` return an arbitrary object.\n\nThis idea means we can go ahead and optimize the common case as initially requested, without worrying about compatibility headaches with future Cython versions.",
