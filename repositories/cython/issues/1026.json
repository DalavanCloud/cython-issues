This diverges from Python's own behaviour.\n\nThe best way to fix this would be to follow Py3 and move the variable out of the surrounding scope (actually, in Py3, it becomes a generator expression, but the result is the same).\n\nThis breaks compatibility with Py2 (and also rather rare code that relies on the variable holding the last value after running the comprehension), but it's certainly worth it.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/465",

Generator expressions will not leak their variables, thus following the behaviour they have in Python 2 and Python 3. The same applies to inlined generator expressions.\n\nIn the current cython-closures branch, the behaviour is a configurable option on the ```ComprehensionNode```, and both comprehensions and generator expressions behave as in Python 2.",
