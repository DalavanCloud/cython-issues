    "body": "For some reason, I'm quite reluctant to rename some source files. (I'm porting to Cython) Yet I want to educate Cython that some of my source file shall be compiled as some other name.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Cython uses file name to generate PyInit_XXX function, where XXX is replaced with file name. Furthermore, complex import pattern are resolved with file name hard coded. And I find no viable or accessible way to try to convince Cython to compile it as a module with different name.\r\n\r\nCopying to a new directory and rename works for source with no import, but it becomes a hard job if I import anything locally. Personally, I'd appreciate if a macro, or something like that is considered for Cython.\r\n\r\nSee also [this post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cython-users/-jLgby4y3G4)",
