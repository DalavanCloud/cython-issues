I have noticed however, that when I do this, it can be easily decompiled, the C files do not seem to be loaded correctly.  Here’s the steps I have undertaken.  I am doing so on windows.\r\n\r\nHA.Py to Pyx with:\r\n```\r\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome(chrome_options = options)\r\ndriver.get('https://google.com')\r\ndriver.close()\r\nI then Convert to pyx (rename Py -> Pyx)\r\nSet up.py\r\nfrom distutils.core import setup\r\nfrom Cython.Build import cythonize\r\nsetup(\r\n    ext_modules = cythonize(\"HA.pyx\")\r\n)\r\n```\r\n```\r\npython setup.py build_ext –inplace  (pyd, I got a so file in Unix)\r\nC:\\Python31\\python.exe C:\\Python31\\Scripts\\cython.py smalltest1.py --embed\r\nCMD:\r\npython setup.py develop\r\n\r\n```\r\n`pyinstaller -r file_a.so,dll,file_a.so -r file_b.so,dll,file_b.so -F /C:/ANDAR`\r\n\r\nIn the folder it contains the pyx, as well as the setup file.\r\n\r\nIt seems that when I compile this, it tends not to run or if I put the python file, it runs with python only and can be easily decompiled.  I have tried creating a c file from Python though this did not seem to work through visual Studios.\r\n\r\n",
