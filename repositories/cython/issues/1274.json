For example, when cythonizing this:\r\n```\r\ncdef object sm = staticmethod\r\n\r\ncdef class A:\r\n    @sm\r\n    def fake_static_method():\r\n        return 42\r\n```\r\nCython complains:\r\n```\r\nMethod fake_static_method has wrong number of arguments (0 declared, 1 or more expected)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried to fix this, but it is not easy since Cython first creates `fake_static_method` as a normal method and then adapts it. For arbitrary decorators to work, the only way would be for Cython to create a non-method function `fake_static_method` and then apply decorators on that.",
