So, I'll try it here.\n\nIt would be nice to have conditional compilation\ndirectives that make multiple inclusion idempotent.\nThe usual guards in the C/C++ world would be:\n\n    #ifndef FOO_H\n    #define FOO_H\n    ...\n    #endif\n\nIn Cython, I have been doing\n    DEF FOO_1 = 1\n    DEF FOO_2 = 1\n    IF FOO_1 == FOO_2:\n        DEF FOO_2 = 2\n        ...\n\nThat seems kind of ugly, though.  Beyond aesthetics,\nit is probably nice in other contexts besides include\nidempotency to test for a name before using it.\n\nSo, I propose a tiny addition to add a new compile-\ntime builtin called DEFINED() that just evaluates\nto a boolean based on whether its string argument\nexists in the compile-time environment.\n\nThis allows the above construct to be written both\nmore simply and more clearly:\n\n    IF not DEFINED(\"FOO\"):\n        DEF FOO = 1\n        ...\n\nName choice follows the principle of least surprise\nsince the lowercase cpp name has similar functionality,\njust like the other conditional compilation features.\n\nHere is a very simple patch that implements this,\nattached as well.\n\ndiff -ruw Cython-0.9.8.orig/Cython/Compiler/Scanning.py Cython-0.9.8/Cython/Compiler/Scanning.py\n--- Cython-0.9.8.orig/Cython/Compiler/Scanning.py       2008-06-11 14:25:34.000000000 -0400\n+++ Cython-0.9.8/Cython/Compiler/Scanning.py    2008-07-17 16:39:27.691882798 -0400\n@@ -186,6 +186,9 @@\n             else:\n                 raise\n \n+    def defined(self, name):\n+        return name in self.entries\n+\n def initial_compile_time_env():\n     benv = CompileTimeScope()\n     names = ('UNAME_SYSNAME', 'UNAME_NODENAME', 'UNAME_RELEASE',\n@@ -201,6 +204,7 @@\n     for name in names:\n         benv.declare(name, getattr(__builtin__, name))\n     denv = CompileTimeScope(benv)\n+    denv.declare('DEFINED', denv.defined)\n     return denv\n \n #------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAt 2008-07-19T15:44:09Z **cb@pdos.csail.mit.edu** added attachment [defined.patch](https://gist.github.com/5ef2075bc55aee7e705659ba63cd9c48)\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/27",
