It is not uncommon to have identical objects on both sides of an equals operator and a pointer comparison is so much faster than a call to ```PyObject_RichCompare()``` that it's worth optimising when the result of the comparison will be used as a boolean value.\n\nHowever, a simple call to ```PyObject_RichCompareBool()``` is not completely identical with ```PyObject_RichCompare()``` + a boolean coercion, e.g. regarding internal typing in Cython and also regarding the runtime error handling code, so Cython would need to do a tiny bit more in order to make this optimisation both safe and correct.",
