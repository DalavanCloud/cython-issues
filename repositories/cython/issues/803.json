Any help would, as\nalways, be greatly appreciated.\n\nFor example:\n\n    cdef void test_args(int number, char letter='C'):\n        print letter\n\n    def test():\n        test_args(3, letter='F')\n\nThis is because cdef functions can't take keyword arguments. The error \n\n    11:13: Cannot convert 'void (int, struct __pyx__test_args *__pyx_optional_args)' to Python object\n\nshould be better...\n```\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/242",
