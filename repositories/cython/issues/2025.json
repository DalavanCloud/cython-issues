If this happens before the declaration analysis (and sometimes even type analysis), we cannot be sure that they are really referring to a specific global or imported name.\r\n\r\nWe should add unambiguous qualified names (such as `asyncio.coroutine` or `__builtins__.range`) to the symbol table `Entry` and have an early step where we detect and annotate global names with these qualified names, so that later pipeline steps can rely on them rather than applying their own heuristics and guessing.",
