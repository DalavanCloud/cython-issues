In some cases I do not care about performance much, but I want the things just work. It's better to have a tool working slowly than non-working at all.\n\nSo it'd be nice to have a knob to make it generate just python code instead of compilation the c++ one.",

            "body": "Thank you, the main motivation was toolchain-related issues: there is a zoo of toolchains with own stdlibs, it's hard to make code built by all of them.\n\nBut a deeper look found that in the case I have encountered the problem was in the C++ code used by the developer, not the cython-generated one. Since there was no such an issue for all these years, I guess that this is not a problem and cython-generated code usually compiles well. I don't close this issue, because the idea may have another uses like debugging, but feel free to do this, if you find that another uses are not enough important.",
