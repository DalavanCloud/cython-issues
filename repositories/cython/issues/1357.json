(in this case foo(double*)\n\nThis seems to be caused by CppClass scope, where not all overloaded_alternatives are inherited from superclass. When debugging CppClassScore.declare_inherited_cpp_attributes() I found out that even methods are in \"base_scope.inherited_var_entries + base_scope.var_entries\" and \"base_scope.cfunc_entries\" was empty. This resulted that code probably meant for variables was used for methods which may cause not-inherited overloaded_alternative.\n\nWild guess is that this is caused by .specialize() not being called yet when declare_inherited_cpp_attributes() is called.",
