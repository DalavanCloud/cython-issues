Maybe we could distinguish between utility types and utility functions, and generate types before the module code generation and utility functions after it? It should be acceptable to require the need for utility types to be known before code generation. Utility types are a rare requirement anyway that should usually depend on the existence of tree nodes rather than special cases that pop up during code generation.\n\nOr maybe utility types really need to become part of the module source tree and symbol tables, just with a separate C code namespace, so that methods and attributes can be properly looked up also during analysis...",
