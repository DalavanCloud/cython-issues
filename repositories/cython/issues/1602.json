    "body": "A dictionary with single-character `unicode` keys queried with a `Py_UNICODE` key will raise a KeyError with bracket access (e.g. `d[k]`), but succeeds with `d.get(k)`, `d.__getitem__(k)`, `k in d`, `d.__contains__(k)`, etc). Here is an example:\r\n\r\n```cython\r\nd = {u'a': 1, u'b': 2}\r\ncdef Py_UNICODE c = u'a'\r\nprint(c, c in d, d.get(c), d.__getitem__(c))  # succeeds\r\nprint(d[c])  # KeyError\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get that maybe `Py_UNICODE` isn't compatible with `unicode`, so the hashes would be different, thus leading to the KeyError, but I wouldn't expect it to work with some methods of dictionary access and not others. This can lead to some hard-to-find bugs.",
