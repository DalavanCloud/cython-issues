    "body": "Hi,\n\nWith the language=\"c++\" option, the following code snippet using array slicing fails to compile properly:\n\n```\nfrom numpy cimport ndarray as ar\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f():\n    cdef ar a1 = np.arange(10)\n    cdef ar new_a1 = np.zeros(a1.size + 2)\n    new_a1[= a1\n```\n\nIt produces the following compilation error:\n\n```\ntest_slices.cpp: In function ‘PyObject* __pyx_pf_11test_slices_f(PyObject*, PyObject*)’:\ntest_slices.cpp:746: error: cannot convert ‘PyArrayObject*’ to ‘PyObject*’ for argument ‘4’ to ‘int PySequence_SetSlice(PyObject*, Py_ssize_t, Py_ssize_t, PyObject*)’\n```\n\nIt seems that there is a cast missing, as the code generated is:\n\n```\n  /* \"/home/hoytak/workspace/cython-tests/slices/test_slices.pyx\":9\n *     cdef ar new_a1 = np.zeros(a1.size + 2)\n * \n *     new_a1[1:-1](1:-1]) = a1             # <<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n * \n *     return new_a1\n */\n  if (PySequence_SetSlice(((PyObject *)__pyx_v_new_a1), 1, -1, __pyx_v_a1) < 0) {__pyx_filename = __pyx_f[0]; __pyx_lineno = 9; __pyx_clineno = __LINE__; goto __pyx_L1_error;}\n```\n\nNote the cast is present in the first argument.  Furthermore, this ONLY happens in C++ mode; I can't reproduce it unless language=\"c++\" is specified.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/451",
