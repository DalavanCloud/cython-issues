The thing is that this isn't legal code and likely just triggers an unforeseen execution path.\n\nI think the fix for this is very easy (but as I said I don't have proper computer access): In ParseTreeTransforms.py, in the PostParse class. There one already disallows this for cdef classes (when visiting a CVarDefNode) and it should be very straightforward to extend this to structs. Then one can pick whatever error message one likes :-)\n\nThanks for the bug report!",
