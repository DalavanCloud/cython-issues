([Of course it is.](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections-abstract-base-classes))\r\n\r\nBeing able to specify fields according to their types rather than their implementing classes is a nice-to-have rather than something that's required for my immediate work, but it's a good practice. See \"Effective Java\", Second Edition, Item 52: \"Refer to objects by their interfaces\" if you're not already familiar with it.",

(I could see the motivation for allowing this just to get the documentation and/or type checking on assignment, but removing the error for non-cimported types would be a regression for when one wants to rely on the concrete implementation.)",
