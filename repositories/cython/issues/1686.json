    "body": "This is less of a bug report and more of a query about an undocumented limit on the number of buffer dimensions. \r\n\r\nThe problem I am dealing with relies on the use of very large, multi-dimensional (ndim>8) numpy arrays. Until recently, I was only using arrays with ndim=7, and everything worked perfectly. However, upon adding an eighth dimension I received a \"More dimensions than the maximum number of buffer dimensions were used.\" error upon compilation.\r\n\r\nIs this a fundamental limit or can it be changed? I have resorted to using the numpy buffer interface with ndim=8, but there is a performance loss. Would a future version of cython allow for a larger/customisable number of buffer dimensions? ",

This feels somewhat like a hack - is there no way that this parameter can be exposed? The code on which I am working is intended to be installed and compiled locally.
