The existing `__new__` method calls the parent class's `__new__` (and to make that work, we have to have a non-cdef Timestamp subclass where `__new__` is defined).\r\n\r\nAs far as I know `datetime.datetime` does not have a `__cinit__`.  What is the recommended way to implement a `__cinit__` method with a parent class?",
