It also uses the ```inline``` reserved word directly, rather than using the ```Py_LOCAL_INLINE``` macro to make sure the correct syntax is used for the compiler / settings in question. (This may be especially important considering the fact that at one point, C99 requires exactly-opposite behaviour from that traditionally offered by GCC, but MSVC doesn't even have ```inline``` as a keyword, so it's kind of moot.)",
