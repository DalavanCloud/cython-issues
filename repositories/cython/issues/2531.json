    "body": "Currently, most Cython users have to implement code in their `setup.py` files to decide whether to recompile the `.pyx` sources with Cython or not, and what to do if Cython is not installed. Essentially this dance:\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/reference/compilation.html#distributing-cython-modules\r\n\r\n[PEP 517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/) and [PEP 518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/) provide ways to configure certain build system tools for a given project. This can be used to provide a simple Cython build package that does this once and for all, is distributed separately via PyPI, and internally calls Cython when necessary and requested, but otherwise just replaces the `.pyx` files by pre-generated `.c` files that come with the source distribution.\r\n\r\nIt would become a dependency of Cython itself and some parts of the `cythonize()` implementation would be moved into the new build package. Meaning, most of the code is already there in one way or another, just needs to be extracted and cleanly put into an external package.\r\n\r\nAlso see #1981, which could be solved at the same time (in a single package).",

This would allow for the setup.py to remain clear of any Cython specific parameters. The build system would only need to be more capable when the user wishes to explicitly run `cythonize` on their code.\r\n\r\nThis additional functionality would ideally be built into setuptools, for example using the setuptools_scm approach. This allows Cython to be detected and only allow `cythonize` to be invoked (perhaps through --cythonize flag to build_ext) if the Cython module exists (I believe the old cython integration into setuptools did something like this). There can also be a new argument for `setup()` which could represent `cythonize_args: {**kwargs}`. \r\n\r\nThe more difficult part about this approach is the fact that for a Cython extension to be built by distutils/setuptools without invoking cythonize, all sources must be specified as their generated filename and not their pyx one which is a shift in mindset and also potentially a non-trivial implementation which applies the reverse transition of .cpp/.c -> .pyx through source file discovery, alternatively this could be done in cythonize itself.",

And triggering this behaviour is easy due to the unique comment at the beginning of Cython generated files. – Assuming that users want this and do not provide their own setup.

I still have my notes from our discussion and will dig them up--it's something I'm still interested in helping with.\r\n\r\nSee also #1514 which brings up my original proposal--which was to add a `build_cython` distutils command, to add an explicit build stage / `setup.py` command that wraps `cythonize()`.  I think this is still a good idea.  But as we discussed in Cernay, and as @scoder raises, there is a little more to it than just adding the command, such as adding metadata to `.pyx` files, etc.",
