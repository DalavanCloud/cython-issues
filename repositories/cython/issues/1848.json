    "body": "At the moment the behavior of the `__richcmp__` function isn't really clear, especially in regards to different types and unsupported comparisons..\r\n\r\nAccording to some testing i did:\r\n- If only one of components is a cdefed class AND has a `__richcmp__` function that function is used irregardless of the component order. If both components have a `__richcmp__` function the lefts components function is used.\r\n- If the comparison is not `==` or `!=` and the left component doesn't support richcmp the op is flipped (< to > and so on) and the richcmp function of the right side is used.\r\n\r\nIs this correct so far ?\r\n\r\nAlso the arithmetic functions support returning `NotImplemented` to signal that they do not support this operation on the given datatypes and the other side should be tried.\r\nIs there something similar for comparisons ?\r\n\r\nI have a Vector class for example, and only want to implement the == and != operations. How should that be handled ?\r\nSimply raise a NotImplementedError would kind of work, but prevents the other side from handling that operation if it is able to.\r\n",
