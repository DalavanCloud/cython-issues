In analyse_expressions(), it retrieves the list of active temps:\n```\n        self.temps_in_use = env.temps_in_use()\n```\nand then frees that in its execution code:\n```\n        for entry in self.temps_in_use:\n            code.put_var_decref_clear(entry)\n```\nLike some other tree transforms, the iter-dict optimisation changes the temp allocation, which leaves some temps unused later in the code, such as the one for the loop iterator in your example. The return statement isn't prepared for that. So the impact of this bug is actually larger than just the iter-dict transform.",
