Also Cython could optimize code related to working with items taken or added to the collections. It's possible the collections themselves could even be implemented at the C level in these cases aiding performance further. Syntax might look as follows.\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ncdef dict[char, int] typecode_sizes\r\n```\r\n\r\nThough these are all just thoughts at this point. Happy to discuss.",
