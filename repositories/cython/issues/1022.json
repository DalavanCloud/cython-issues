    "body": "While compiling lxml with safe type inference enabled, it failed in one place: when calling two functions conditionally, one of which returned 'unicode', the other one returning 'bytes'. The reason was that the first type wasn't really 'unicode' but a type that was redeclared in a .pxd (to support subtyping):\n```\n    ctypedef class __builtin__.unicode [PyUnicodeObject](object):\n        pass\n```\nThis type was also used for function return types in the .pxd and Cython ended up inferring it as the spanning type of ```[bytes,unicode]```, the latter being the redeclared type. This is because Cython doesn't know the exact type here, so it allows assignment from any Python type, delegating the error to runtime. This makes the incomplete 'unicode' type the perfect spanning type for any Python type, including 'bytes', which clearly needs fixing.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/461",

This should be reasonably safe, and it will hopefully prevent similar problems with incomplete types in the future.\n\nhttp://hg.cython.org/cython-devel/rev/1d8814e6e5d0\nhttp://hg.cython.org/cython-devel/rev/f7f92b75b5cc",
