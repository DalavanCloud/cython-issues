Many projects adopt a X.Y.Z style of versioning where the major (X) number denotes large project or API changes, the minor (Y) number denotes new or changed features, and the micro (Z) number denotes bug fixes or patches.\r\n\r\nAlso having a version less than 1 may cause the uninitiated to think that the project is unstable, in early development, or is not suited for operational use when in fact it is and has been used in this way for a while.\r\n\r\nIs there any chance that Cython's next release or a release in the near future could be changed to 1.x.x?",

We have not yet had a \"large project or API change\" that would merit bumping the major version number, and as this thread is about messaging, I'd like to point out that doing so would also send a message, so it's unlikely to \"just happen\" because time passed. \r\n\r\nWe had discussions years ago about what 1.0 would look like: what we should be sure to get in, what we'd like to finally cut/simplify. That's a fine topic to open (though a wiki page or mailing list would be a more appropriate forum than a github issue). ",
