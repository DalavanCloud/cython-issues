Examples:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/432\r\n- https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/5343\r\n- https://morepypy.blogspot.ca/2018/04/how-to-ignore-annoying-cython-warnings.html\r\n\r\nThe second link is an example of NumPy devs considering not merging a clear improvement because of this warning, and the third one of PyPy devs publishing a complete package just to install a warning filter to work around the false alarm. \r\n\r\nWhen package authors know that it's going to be a user-visible false alarm (and it's quite an alarming/confusing one for users), then giving them an option to do a release with the check disabled seems quite valuable.\r\n\r\n",

So in my second example it then required yet another filter.\r\n- filters are global and can be reset. To make test suites reproducible it makes sense to start with `warnings.resetwarnings()` and then add your own filters (this is what numpy's test runner does, which many projects use).\r\n- The Python warnings mechanism has issues (up to Python 3.6 IIRC) with filters that were reset and then re-added, those didn't work.\r\n\r\nIn general, I'd just much prefer to have a single silence flag that can be passed to Cython, because this issue keeps popping up and wastes a lot of time. And I've personally never encountered a single case where it was useful, so I'd rather investigate the first time that does happen rather than every time it's a false alarm.",
