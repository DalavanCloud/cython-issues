Examples:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/432\r\n- https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/5343\r\n- https://morepypy.blogspot.ca/2018/04/how-to-ignore-annoying-cython-warnings.html\r\n\r\nThe second link is an example of NumPy devs considering not merging a clear improvement because of this warning, and the third one of PyPy devs publishing a complete package just to install a warning filter to work around the false alarm. \r\n\r\nWhen package authors know that it's going to be a user-visible false alarm (and it's quite an alarming/confusing one for users), then giving them an option to do a release with the check disabled seems quite valuable.\r\n\r\n",

So in my second example it then required yet another filter.\r\n- filters are global and can be reset. To make test suites reproducible it makes sense to start with `warnings.resetwarnings()` and then add your own filters (this is what numpy's test runner does, which many projects use).\r\n- The Python warnings mechanism has issues (up to Python 3.6 IIRC) with filters that were reset and then re-added, those didn't work.\r\n\r\nIn general, I'd just much prefer to have a single silence flag that can be passed to Cython, because this issue keeps popping up and wastes a lot of time. And I've personally never encountered a single case where it was useful, so I'd rather investigate the first time that does happen rather than every time it's a false alarm.",

So if you run cython-gnerated code against a newer numpy, the sizes don't match -- but as long as the run-time struct is bigger, it it even an issue? couldn't cython do a >= test an only raise if the run-time struct is smaller (which maybe should be an Exception, and not a warning!)\r\n\r\n3) The warning message is very confusing, for example:\r\n\r\n`RuntimeWarning: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96, got 88`\r\n\r\nThat makes it look like the run-time size is _smaller_ than expected -- which would be very concerning. But IIUC, it's actually the other way around. So at the very least, can the message be corrected?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
