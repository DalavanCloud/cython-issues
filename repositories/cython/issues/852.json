Yes, I should probably get and decref the module (though it won't matter much as I call Py_Finalize next. \n\n3) In case of errors, process return value should match what core\nCPython returns en case of unhandled execptions.\n\nDo you know of a good list? (Otherwise, I'll just try some.) \n\n3) However, a SystemExit exceptions should need some special\nconsideration, as you should extract the process return value from it,\nas it could be 0 (zero).\n\nGood point. \n```\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/291",
