The generated etree.c file still references `exc_type`.\r\n\r\nHere are the steps I've used to reproduce the problem:\r\n\r\n* macOS 10.12.6, Xcode Version 9.1 (9B55)\r\n* clone the CPython repo, configure, make, make altinstall (i.e. to /usr/local)\r\n* `python3.7 -mvenv /tmp/py37`\r\n* `source /tmp/py37/bin/activate`\r\n* clone the Cython repo, cd into that\r\n* `pip install -e .` from inside the virtualenv\r\n```\r\n(py37) % type cython\r\ncython is /tmp/py37/bin/cython\r\n(py37) % cython --version\r\nCython version 0.28a0\r\n```\r\n* clone the [lxml repo](http://lxml.de/index.html#download) and cd into that\r\n* `make inplace`\r\n\r\nThis yields tons of warnings and one error.  But it's definitely using the pip installed Cython:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(py37) % find . -name \\*.c\r\n(py37) % make inplace\r\npython setup.py  build_ext -i  --with-cython --warnings --with-coverage\r\nBuilding lxml version 4.1.0.\r\nBuilding with Cython 0.28a0.\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/lxml/etree.c:259432:24: error: no member named 'exc_type' in 'struct _ts'\r\n    if (!__pyx_tstate->exc_type) {\r\n         ~~~~~~~~~~~~  ^\r\n356 warnings and 1 error generated.\r\nCompile failed: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n```c\r\n    if (!__pyx_tstate->exc_type) {\r\n        Py_INCREF(PyExc_StopIteration);\r\n        __Pyx_ErrRestore(PyExc_StopIteration, exc, NULL);\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo what am I doing wrong, or is this a bug in lxml, or is Cython still not quite fixed yet?",
