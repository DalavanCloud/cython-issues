    "body": "IIRC `cdef` and `yield` don't play together nicely.  I'm wondering if this can be made viable by some kind of reverse-inlining in some subset of situations.\r\n\r\nThe motivation is from pandas timezone-conversion functions, which have a lot of repetition that in python-land we could avoid with `yield`.  (One cast of several: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/_libs/tslib.pyx#L128)\r\n\r\nThe relevant functions all look something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef myfunc(...):\r\n    if condition1:\r\n        for i in range(N):\r\n            val = func1(values[n])\r\n            callback(val, ...)\r\n    elif condition2:\r\n        for i in range(N):\r\n            val = func2(values[n])\r\n            callback(val, ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the only difference between the repeated code is in `callback`  (we can't _actually_ pass a callback because they have different signatures).\r\n\r\nIt seems like it should be possible to write:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncdef myfunc(...):\r\n    for val in cyielder(...):\r\n         callback(val)\r\n\r\ncdef cyielder(...):\r\n    if condition1:\r\n        for i in range(N):\r\n            val = func1(values[n])\r\n            cyield val\r\n    elif condition2:\r\n        for i in range(N):\r\n            val = func2(values[n])\r\n            cyield val\r\n```\r\n\r\nand have `cyielder` inlined to make these two versions of `myfunc` equivalent.  Is this at all plausible?",
