    "body": "Since 0.28a0, Cython adds `Coroutine.cr_code` attribute.  Existing asyncio code `asyncio/coroutines.py/_format_coroutine()` checks if it exists and if it does, looks for `cr_frame`.  The latter attribute lookup causes an `AttributeError`, making coroutines compiled with 0.28 break asyncio.\r\n\r\nI suggest to implement `Coroutine.cr_frame` getter for Cython coroutines that would always return `None`.",
