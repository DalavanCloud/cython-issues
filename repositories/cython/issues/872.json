No visible regression, but a lot of nice features.\n\nCrashes during reload are just fine IMO, as reload isn't really something that Py2 supports anyway. It's a pure test/debug feature, so if it works in some cases, that's a lot better than nothing.\n\nThe original discussion that lead to this patch is here:\n\nhttp://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.cython.devel/5993\n\nApplied here:\n\nhttp://hg.cython.org/cython-devel/rev/e6394932acef",
