    "body": "I have a cython module where I'm trying to expose a typename variable of a c++ templated class.\r\n\r\nHere are related links [link1] and [link2] from before 2013, so I wonder if it is now implemented, and they say it's not implemented.\r\nI have scanned the whole web, and I'm surprised to see almost no info about this. Try googling \"cython expose c++ typename\": there's nothing except stuff about templates.\r\n\r\n### *just a thought:\r\nIn my .pyx file, after I define the cppclass, I use it in other functions with a specified template typename. So in principle, since cython translates .pyx to .cpp, I'm thinking that this templated-class-typename is well defined.\r\nWhat I mean, is that this typename variable is defined at compile time, and not a runtime; therefore, this typename-exposing-feature is cython-feasible right?\r\n\r\n[link1]:http://grokbase.com/t/gg/cython-users/136v44ees2/wrap-c-template-function-with-multiple-template-parameter-and-typdef-for-specific-instantiations-of-the-typdef\r\n[link2]:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cython-users/qQpMo3hGQqI",
