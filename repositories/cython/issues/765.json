Declaring them as nogil does the trick, but this can cause\nother sorce code changed. For example, in Cython/Include, you have a\npxd with C stdlib stuff. These declarations do not have the 'nogil',\nthen you cannot use them inside other 'nogil' functions.\n```\n\nSo,\n\n1) a transform is run which flags function nodes according to whether they contain Python expressions\n\n2) this flag must be false if they are nogil\n\n3) this flag is also used for the refnanny instead of nogil",
