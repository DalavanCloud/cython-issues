Rather than that,  I would like to know where to find documentation about all the different behaviors between CPython and Cython, so I can avoid using that language constructs.\r\n\r\nAnd thank you for the great job you're doing!",

CPython evaluates the iterable directly when creating the generator (i.e. outside of the generator itself), Cython does it when starting it, i.e. inside. That's one of the biggest bugs that Cython currently has. Doesn't show very often, but it can.\r\n\r\nRegarding a list of current differences, I think the issue tracker serves that need best:\r\nhttps://github.com/cython/cython/labels/Python%20Semantics",
