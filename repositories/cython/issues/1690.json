It's definitely harmless, but probably worth taking a look in this case.\r\n\r\nThe \"missing\" break is intentional. The switch statement is essentially used as a jump-ahead goto here. It appears in pretty much every function with a Python signature.\r\n\r\nThe missing initialisation of \"`__pyx_r`\" is usually a false positive but could also refer to a real bug in your own code here. My guess is, however, that coverty is unable to understand the exception handling path here, which should ignore the partially uninitialised struct in the calling code.",
