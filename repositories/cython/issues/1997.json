It can already be difficult in some unfortunate cases to bring C includes into a non-conflicting and/or dependency enforced order, even without having Cython reorder them at will. This makes the situation worse, while providing no benefit for majority of users.\r\n\r\nIt also feels like the situation changes a bit with the new verbatim C code feature, but it's unclear if it's for better or worse, as the feature hasn't seen any real-world usage yet. From the surface, the interaction might have both benefits and uncertainties.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would prefer if we could make this an opt-in of some sort, or really make the late includes explicit, as jdemeyer originally proposed.",
