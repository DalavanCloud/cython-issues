    "body": "It would be nice if Cython could emulate the instance methods of Python types on the corresponding C types (such as int or float). That way, you could say\n```\n    cdef float f = 0.5\n    print f.is_integer()\n```\nThis would not necessarily be efficiently implemented as plain C code (especially when there is no trivial implementation or corresponding C-API call). It's only meant to make C types a bit simpler to use from a Python POV.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/236",
