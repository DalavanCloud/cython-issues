    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'd like to use namespace package like functionality when using cimport. I think most of the pieces are there already. It seems like just changing \"check_package_dir\" in Utils.py to not check for __init__ files would be sufficient?\r\n\r\nAlso I noticed that the pyx search (find_pyx_file in Main.py) doesn't keep the sys_path argument. Is there a reason for that?\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure what the impact of these changes would be so I wanted your thoughts before submitting a PR.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n-- PG",
