    "body": "On mips, the `st_rdev` and `st_dev` fields of `struct stat` are of type `long unsigned int` rather than `dev_t` for $REASONS. The `posix/stat.pxd` file shipped with Cython correctly defines them as `dev_t`. To get my source code to compile under mips, I therefore thought I'd just teach Cython about this peculiarity:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom posix.stat cimport *\r\ncdef extern from \"<sys/stat.h>\" nogil:\r\n    cdef struct struct_mstat \"stat\":\r\n        int   st_dev\r\n        ino_t   st_ino\r\n        mode_t  st_mode\r\n        nlink_t st_nlink\r\n        uid_t   st_uid\r\n        gid_t   st_gid\r\n        int st_rdev\r\n        off_t   st_size\r\n        blksize_t st_blksize\r\n        blkcnt_t st_blocks\r\n        time_t  st_atime\r\n        time_t  st_mtime\r\n        time_t  st_ctime\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this did not have any effect at all. On further investigation, renaming eg `st_ino` to `st_ino_fo` did not result in any warnings either.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that Cython silently uses its own definition of `struct stat`, and ignores everything that attempts to re-define it. I would have expected that a more local declaration takes predecence. But even more important, I think Cython should at least warn if it encounters such a conflicting definition.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The issue is some projects rely on being able to re-declare things (e.g. they use `pxi` files that have definitions that get included multiple times). ",
