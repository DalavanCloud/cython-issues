    "body": "The usefulness of the `Cython/Shadow.py` module for pure Python code is currently limited by the difficulty of shipping it to users, without conflicting with other packages that would try to install it, etc.\r\n\r\nIt would probably be best to ship it as a completely separate package on PyPI (e.g. `noncython` or `pycython`) that user packages can simply depend on for the non-compiled case. This would also give us a suitable vehicle for shipping the PEP-484 typing stub for Cython's type system, by including it in that package.",
