With code like\n```\ntry:\n  return x\nfinally:\n  return y\n```\nthen ```x``` is leaked, because ReturnStatNode assumes that ```__pyx_r``` is empty.\n\nThe fix is of course easy; assign ```__pyx_r``` to None initially and decref it on assignments. However, this adds an additional decref to every single function with object return values.\n\nThis is another thing that longer-term would be solved by control flow analysis.",
