PEP 484-style types are supposed to have no runtime effects; would a .py file compiled with Cython that has type annotations violate this? Cython's type system is neither a subset of superset of the typing module's system, and it's not clear the best way to extend it. (E.g. would List[str] require runtime checks on getting and setting items?) Also, cdef declares more than just type, it's also used to declare scope (e.g. cdef, cpdef, and def functions cannot be inferred from the argument/return types, and we need modifiers on class attribute visibility). \r\n\r\nThat being said, I would like to see this fleshed out into a full proposal (maybe on the wiki) that addresses these issues.

But the first impression is similar, it would be great to support some basic generics like ``List[int]`` and ``numpy.ndarray``. (There are actually some basic stubs for the latter, see https://github.com/machinalis/mypy-data/tree/master/numpy-mypy, so that mypy partially works with it, more support is planned later for fixed size/shape arrays, see https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/3345 and https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/3540.)",

It has nothing to do with the annotation syntax specifically.\r\n\r\nWhen I wrote that \"everything else is ignored\", I meant the typing expressions like `List[int]` or `Optional[Tuple[...]]`. While some of them could be used as Cython type declarations, supporting them can happy come later. They are not critical and most of them are not even useful (especially the standard container types aren't).",
