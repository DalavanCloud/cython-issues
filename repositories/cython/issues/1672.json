PEP 484-style types are supposed to have no runtime effects; would a .py file compiled with Cython that has type annotations violate this? Cython's type system is neither a subset of superset of the typing module's system, and it's not clear the best way to extend it. (E.g. would List[str] require runtime checks on getting and setting items?) Also, cdef declares more than just type, it's also used to declare scope (e.g. cdef, cpdef, and def functions cannot be inferred from the argument/return types, and we need modifiers on class attribute visibility). \r\n\r\nThat being said, I would like to see this fleshed out into a full proposal (maybe on the wiki) that addresses these issues.
