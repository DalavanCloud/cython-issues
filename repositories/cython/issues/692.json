Supporting this might depend on better flow analysis.\n\nA half-way-there implementation for local Python variables can be DECREF-ing them and setting them to NULL on \"del\", so that you'd get a compile time crash if you use them later on. This expects that users who use \"del\" know what they are doing.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/132",

Horrible for speed but if you want speed, just set the objects to None instead. I think this is more reasonable than expecting the users of del to be experts.",
