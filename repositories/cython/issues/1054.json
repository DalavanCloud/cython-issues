In general it's pretty easy to work around in Python 2:\n```\nA.foo = types.MethodType(foo, None, A)\n```\nBut somewhat troublesome in Python 3. The best suggestion I got was:\n```\nA.foo = functools.update_wrapper(lambda *a, **kw: foo(*a, **kw), foo)\n```\n\nIt's a weird gotcha, but engineering a workaround without introducing performance penalties is likely difficult (if not impossible). Perhaps the best option is just to document it and move on.",

However, Cython creates ```PyCFunctions``` which do not properly bind when accessed (possibly by design). This is the root issue behind http://trac.cython.org/ticket/478, and will become more evident once closures start getting used. \n\n```PyCFunction``` does not allow subclassing. The only reasonable fix I see is to create a new type that wraps ```PyCFunction``` but behaves like ```PyFunction```. This will have indirection overhead. To avoid overhead, one alternative is for our new type to have the same struct and slots as ```PyCFunction``` (with the exception of ```tp_name, tp_descr_get, tp_alloc```, and ```tp_dealloc``` of course). This still may have overhead as the Python compiler optimizes for ```PyCFunction``` calls--perhaps the user should be allowed to control this (as part of an \"ultra pure, I don't care what cost\" mode...)?\n**resolution** to `fixed`\n**status** from `new` to `closed`\ncommented\n\nThis works with the \"binding=True\" directive, which is now (since 0.17 IIRC) on by default for .py files.",
