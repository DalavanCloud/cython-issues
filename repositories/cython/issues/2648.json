    "body": "After I read this [blog post](https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2018/09/inside-cpyext-why-emulating-cpython-c.html) about why emulating the CPython API is so hard for PyPy I raised the fact that we could introduce PyPy specific GC hooks for the cpyext layer in PyPy's IRC channel.\r\nThese would be used by Cython instead of `Py_INCREF` and `Py_DECREF` etc. to track the lifetime objects.\r\nWe're wondering what are the API requirements from Cython's side to implement such a thing.\r\nHow do you imagine such API to look like?\r\nHow hard would it be to generate code that uses those hooks?\r\nWhat do you think that should happen if a Cython uses `Py_INCREF` or other memory management macro manually? Should this feature be hidden under a feature flag?",
