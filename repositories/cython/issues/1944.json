    "body": "The reason for this macro is for when someone wants to ``PyImport_AppendInittab`` an cython C code generated module on their own embedded python interpreter. As such then it avoid's exporting symbols on exe files which is a bad idea.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n#if PY_MAJOR_VERSION < 3\r\nPyMODINIT_FUNC init[modulename](void); /*proto*/\r\nPyMODINIT_FUNC init[modulename](void)\r\n#else\r\n+ #ifdef CYTHON_NO_EXPORTS\r\n+ /* when compiling cython code in user made embedded python applications.*/\r\n+ #undef PyMODINIT_FUNC\r\n+ #define PyMODINIT_FUNC PyObject*\r\n+ #endif\r\nPyMODINIT_FUNC PyInit_[modulename](void); /*proto*/\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd yes it's good to have this define constant in all cython generated modules to prevent the annoying exports. In this case of mine I must use cython on this module and I must not use cython for the embedding as I have to run some other things on it on top of the cython stuff that the cythonized module cant do.\r\n\r\nWhen I added this it has no difference in runtime and it does not export the ``PyInit_`` function on the module it uses as I am embedding python 3.6.x.",

See the embedding test for that, under `Demos/embed`. Probably also something to consider in `cython_freeze`.\r\n\r\nAnd since you asked: no, this is nothing to add in a bug-fix point release.",
