If it's possible to implement them as alternative entries instead of just keeping their cname around, I'm all for that.\n\n2) Even when declaring the method before calling it, it uses the wrong cast for the 'self' type during the call, which leads to a C compiler warning. This might(!) hint at a more general problem with the way we inherit cdef method entries from base types.\n\nAt 2013-08-29T05:04:34Z **scoder** added attachment [try_to_fix_inherited_final_methods.patch](https://gist.github.com/e4e11306f0795a563b93ca3ed7b8d2b0)\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/819",
