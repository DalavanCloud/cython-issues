    "body": "I am encountering the following issue. In .pyx file I declare a wrapper Python class around a C++ class, which makes use of Open MPI parallelism. I compile the code using distutils, specifying CC=mpicc.openmpi, CXX=mpicxx.openmpi. Then I run a Python script which imports the wrapped class by mpirun.openmpi and get the following error message\r\n\r\n```\r\nmca: base: component_find: unable to open /usr/lib/openmpi/lib/openmpi/mca_shmem_posix: /usr/lib/openmpi/lib/openmpi/mca_shmem_posix.so: undefined symbol: opal_shmem_base_framework (ignored)\r\nmca: base: component_find: unable to open /usr/lib/openmpi/lib/openmpi/mca_shmem_sysv: /usr/lib/openmpi/lib/openmpi/mca_shmem_sysv.so: undefined symbol: opal_show_help (ignored)\r\nmca: base: component_find: unable to open /usr/lib/openmpi/lib/openmpi/mca_shmem_mmap: /usr/lib/openmpi/lib/openmpi/mca_shmem_mmap.so: undefined symbol: opal_show_help (ignored)\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIt looks like opal_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is\r\nlikely to abort.

This issue does not show up when running a binary compiled from the C++ source including the aforementioned class. \r\n\r\nI think this issue has been observed before: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26901663/error-when-running-openmpi-based-library , however I would like to avoid having to create a custom Open MPI build. Is there a simpler workaround of this problem?\r\n\r\n",
