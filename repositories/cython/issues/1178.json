    "body": "Large integer literals can result in truncated values in the C code. The only safe way to handle them is to write safe literals (usually < 32bit) into the source as literals and use cached Python objects for all larger values.\n\nThe only exception is when a literal is clearly written as C literal, in which case it should end up in the code unchanged. However, the literal syntax can be ambiguous and must be parsed depending on the Python source language level as follows.\n\nWhen parsing integer literals in Python 2 files, the \"L\" suffix refers to Python's \"long\" type. However, when parsing in -3 mode, this suffix is invalid and can safely be assumed to mean a C long literal. Similarly, the \"LL\" and \"U\" suffixes always refer to a C typed literal.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/619",
