What might be an indication that \nthere is an \"exceptional\" situation?\n\nFor software packaging the issue is that two packages want to own the \nsame file - so the second package (generally) ends up owning it. If that \npackage gets removed, the file disappears.\n\nHowever, knowing this, and the names of both packages I can add some \ninstall logic to test for the other during install and uninstall - and, \nthinking out loud, add or remove a link to cython2 and/or cython3 as \n$prefix/bin/cython.\n\nThanks for the reply.\n\nHowever, this is still 'unresolved' for pip(3) install/uninstall.\n\n",
