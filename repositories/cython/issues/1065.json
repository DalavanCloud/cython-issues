In particular, when we have cimports that correspond to compiler directives, we want to eliminate the `CImportStatNode`, and otherwise we want to leave it in place. I did that, and also cleaned up/refactored the code a little bit. (I started thinking that I could make it even cleaner, but the little differences between things like `ImportStatNode` and `CImportStatNode` made it not quite worth it.)\n\nFix pushed:\n\n  http://hg.cython.org/cython-devel/rev/201bfb42af42",
