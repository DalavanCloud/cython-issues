    "body": "Currently, the type inferencer is happy to infer any Python type. However, in the case that it infers that something is of type `str`, it will no longer allow automatic coercion between that object and a `char *`. While one could argue that this is morally a good idea, it's going to break huge amounts of existing user code (for instance in Sage). \n\nAn easy fix is to simply make the inference of `str` unsafe. This means that it's off by default, so users won't hit it by accident. Of course, this is frustrating in the case that a user does want to try out \"unsafe\" type inference, or if we want to start inferring `str` for other reasons. There are at least three obvious things we can do to fix this in the long term:\n\n * Revisit the issue of `str <--> char *` coercion, at least for Py2 only\n * Separate the \"infer `str` type\" decision from other type inference, via any of the usual mechanisms\n * Make people change their existing code.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/553",

So disallowing it saves time and effort.",

Even worse, it's not a fixed type at all, but a kind of meta type that changes depending on the C compile time/Python runtime environment, and that behaves different in different environments. For example, ```str.decode()``` does not exist in Py3, whereas ```str.encode()``` behaves unpredictably in Py2. So the actual usefulness of this type is clearly limited, almost exclusively to error messages and docstrings, IMHO.\n\nThe problem here is not the type inference, but the type mutation of str. The type inference actually does the right thing and makes user errors more easily apparent.",
