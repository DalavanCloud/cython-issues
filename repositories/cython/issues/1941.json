Since `setup_requires` is a setuptools option, and recent setuptools versions know about Cython modules, I wouldn't be surprised if leaving out the `cmd_class` fixed it.\r\n\r\nOTOH, I generally discourage depending on Cython in the normal user build process. Instead, ship the generated `.c` files in the sdist. Makes it much easier to reason about the code that users are executing on their side. Cython code is \"translate once, build everywhere\".",

            "body": "Since Nov. 2016 it seems to work to import the `Extension` class from `setuptools` and pass it a `pyx`-file. If you *do not* import `Cython` in your `setup.py` and defines `cython` as a setup requirement (`setup_requires=['cython']`), `setuptools` will figure out the rest for you. This should work with `setuptools` version 18.0 or higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Minimal example\r\n\r\nMinimal example for `setup.py`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom setuptools import setup, Extension\r\nfrom setuptools.command.build_ext import build_ext\r\n\r\nsetup(\r\n    ...\r\n    setup_requires=['cython'],\r\n    ext_modules=[Extension(\"*\", [\"*.pyx\"])],\r\n    cmdclass={'build_ext': build_ext}\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example with cython, numpy and openmp\r\n\r\nIf you need numpy headers and openmp support it becomes slightly more complicated. The best way I found is the following `setup.py` layout:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom setuptools import setup, Extension\r\nfrom setuptools.command.build_ext import build_ext as _build_ext\r\n\r\n# bootstrap numpy\r\n# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19919905/how-to-bootstrap-numpy-installation-in-setup-py\r\nclass build_ext(_build_ext):\r\n    def finalize_options(self):\r\n        _build_ext.finalize_options(self)\r\n        # Prevent numpy from thinking it is still in its setup process:\r\n        __builtins__.__NUMPY_SETUP__ = False\r\n        import numpy\r\n        self.include_dirs.append(numpy.get_include())\r\n\r\next_modules = [\r\n    Extension(\r\n        \"*\",\r\n        [\"*.pyx\"],\r\n        extra_compile_args=['-fopenmp'],\r\n        extra_link_args=['-fopenmp'],\r\n    )\r\n]\r\n\r\nsetup(\r\n    ...\r\n    setup_requires=['numpy', 'cython'],\r\n    ext_modules=ext_modules,\r\n    cmdclass={'build_ext': build_ext}\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n\r\nDuring investigating this \"problem\", I found this template for a `setup.py`, which looks interesting and seems to solve many of the suggested and similar problems:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Technologicat/setup-template-cython\r\n\r\n\r\n## Sources\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/douban/libmc/pull/45/files\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/38057196\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/19919905/how-to-bootstrap-numpy-installation-in-setup-py\r\n",
