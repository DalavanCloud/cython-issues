Since `setup_requires` is a setuptools option, and recent setuptools versions know about Cython modules, I wouldn't be surprised if leaving out the `cmd_class` fixed it.\r\n\r\nOTOH, I generally discourage depending on Cython in the normal user build process. Instead, ship the generated `.c` files in the sdist. Makes it much easier to reason about the code that users are executing on their side. Cython code is \"translate once, build everywhere\".",
