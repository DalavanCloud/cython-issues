The `NonManglingModuleScope` class defined in `UtilityCode.py` is a workaround; it would be better to refactor the `Scope.mangle` methods (and related mangling methods) to something like\n```\ndef mangle(self, ...):\n    self.context.mangle(...)\n```\nWhich gives us inversion of control.\n\nSome more thoughts excepted from email:\n\n```\n> Turns out the UtilityCode.NonManglingModuleScope implementation of\n> mangle() doesn't get called at the right times when parsing/defining\n> the cython.array implementation.\n>\n> When cython.array is parsed, it gets a CClassScope as it should, and\n> the CClassScope's outer_scope is, correctly, a NonManglingModuleScope\n> instance.  When mangle() is called, it uses the default\n> Scope.mangle(), but it should use outer_scope.mangle() which would\n> call NonManglingModuleScope.mangle().  I added an implementation of\n> mangle() inside CClassScope to always call outer_scope.mangle(), but\n> this ends up breaking code -- I'm not certain why and to figure it out\n> would take more time than I'd like to invest at the moment.\n>\n>\n\nGood thinking. Yes, you are correct; if you can file the ticket it would\nbe great. Looking ahead to solving this there are two ways to go about it:\n\n[...]\n\n2) Refactor all the mangling. I'd strongly prefer this as the above (and\nall of NonManglingModuleScope) is a bit of a hack. Ideally I think each\nscope would call\n\nself.context.mangle(scope, entry)\n\nand then all current mangling rules would be moved to the Context objects.\nThis seems to be a better design in general (IoC etc.; in particular\nSymtab now essentially hard-codes how mangling gets done; having some\nstrings set in Naming.py doesn't change that).\n```\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/345",
