It's much easier to disallow the whole thing. Also, while I understand that you have already structured your code using this \"feature\", I can't see a reason why supporting this is better than requiring users to make the memoryview a class member rather than a sub-struct member. It just leads to different ways of accessing the view, but IMHO makes it clearer what the responsibilities for the lifetime management are.\r\n\r\nSorry for the inconvenience, but this \"feature\" was inherently unsafe before. No offence, @MarcCote and @c-f-h , but I wouldn't be surprised if your code bases were also suffering from memory leaks and/or crashes under certain (rare) conditions, similar to what the OP reported. Even if you took good care to avoid this, it's an easy source of bugs for new developers in your teams who are less familiar with the constraints.\r\n\r\n@c-f-h, I would consider a pull request that implements this as a new feature.",
