    "body": "In Python, ```__getitem___``` has been preferred over ```__getslice__``` for ages and ```__getslice__``` is gone for good in Python 3. However, Cython still generates slicing code instead of item getting code for performance reasons. It hard codes the slice sizes and calls ```PySequence_GetSlice()``` with ```Py_ssize_t``` arguments. This leads to a difference to Python when creating the slice object.\n\nIn Python, ```obj[:]``` calls the object's ```__getitem__``` method with ```slice(None,None,None)``` as argument. In Cython, the slice is created as ```slice(0,PY_SSIZE_T_MAX,None)```.\n\nAt least in Python 3, where ```PySequence_GetSlice()``` always creates a slice object, this is worth fixing (and optimising by using a constant slice object for constant cases). In Python 2, the slice object is only created when the class defines ```__getitem__``` and not ```__getslice__```, which makes it trickier to fix.\n\nNote that the same applies to ```SetItem``` and ```DelItem```.\n\nAlso note that it is not enough to translate any ```Py_SSIZE_T_MAX``` into ```None```, as the user may well have deliberately used this value.\n\nFirst reported for Debian here:\n\nhttp://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=604963\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/636",
