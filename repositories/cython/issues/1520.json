This excerpt was distilled down from code for a dense neural network; hence the desire for a vector of memoryviews (different layer sizes + efficiency).  Seems like the bugs should be fixed though; to see, extract mwe.tar.gz, and run either `python mweLoader.py 1` or `python mweLoader.py 2`.  The code uses pyximport, so it's self contained.\r\n\r\nIssue 1: Segmentation fault when trying to access a vector's memoryview.\r\n\r\nIssue 2: Compilation failure, with `mwe2.cpp:1892:44: error: 'None' was not declared in this scope`.\r\n\r\n[mwe.tar.gz](https://github.com/cython/cython/files/584640/mwe.tar.gz)\r\n\r\nPS - Python 3.5.1 in case it matters.",

Frankly, I assume that memoryview is already represented as a C or C++ object.  Why not have that object use constructor / destructor to enact ref counting?
