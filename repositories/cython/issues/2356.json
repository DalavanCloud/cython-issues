    "body": "Cython modules tend to be big (see #2102) and certain parts are the same for all modules. Especially in large installations, it would reduce the overall binary size to extract the shareable parts into a dedicated shared library that all modules link against.\r\n\r\nRandom notes:\r\n- Some internal types are already shared across modules, but their code is still duplicated across all modules. The first imported Cython module (of a given Cython version) registers it globally for all others, which will then not use their own implementations.\r\n- Cython can already extract its helpers into dedicated header files to reduce the build overhead. A shared library could be based on that.\r\n- Much of the performance of Cython code comes from inlined (and compile time streamlined) functions. Extracting those into a shared library would probably slow things down visibly, but could be a tradeoff.\r\n- Using a shared library adds quite some complexity. The library could be used globally for a Python installation (in which case it's unclear how to find it and which one to use if there are multiple), or local to an installed package. The latter is probably simpler but still requires some coordination on user side. A global library could come in as a separate package dependency that the Cython project could provide, but would introduce an exact version dependency based on the Cython version that a package was built with.\r\n- It is not entirely clear how to deal with the runtime linking here. A real shared library would have to be loaded together with the Cython module, i.e. there would have to be a way for the shared library loader to find it. It might be easier (and more portable) to use a Python extension module and explicitly import the code from there via capsules, in the same way that Cython currently imports its shared types from the first imported module.\r\n- Such a shared library would have to be complete in order to be usable by all Cython generated modules. It would thus be larger than what most single Cython modules (and even some small sets of Cython modules) actually need.\r\n- The potential gain is unclear. For large installations, there is certainly a gain even if only the shared types are extracted from each of the modules. However, large installations are rare. If a shared library is created on a per-package basis, there will still be a lot of duplication in a given Python installation.",

Start with `CythonFunction.c`, `Coroutine.c` and `AsyncGen.c`, potentially also the memoryviews support, but that is probably more difficult.\r\n- Add a new option `shared_module` to `cythonize()` that takes the qualified module name of a shared module to generate. For example, the `lxml` package would say something like `shared_module=\"lxml._cython_shared\"`.\r\n- Make Cython generate the shared module on request, by dropping _all_ the shared utility code into it, and also the code that exports them as the Cython ABI module (which already exists, see `ImportExport.c` and the related code snippets in the utility code files named above).\r\n- Make Cython exclude the shared code from all the other modules and instead only use the existing shared importing code (which is used to share types and functions across Cython modules that currently duplicate their implementations).\r\n- Don't forget to put a runtime version check into the sharing code to detect the case where only some of the modules in the package get rebuilt, but with a different Cython version. If the Cython version that generated the shared module does not match the version that generated the module that tries to use it, it should fail on import with a clear error message that the whole package needs to be recompiled with a single Cython version.\r\n\r\nThis is a bit of work, but seems relatively easy to do.
