    "body": "Basically, setting `language_level=3` breaks `cimport` statements with one or more nested directory. \r\n\r\nIf you have `mypackage/mycymod.pyx` that does a `cimport` of `mypackage/ext/stuff/mywrappers.pxd`, like by doing `from ext.stuff.mywrappers cimport MyThing`, this works fine with `language_level=2` but breaks with `language_level=3`, where all of a sudden the Cython compiler reports that it cannot find any of the .pxd files e.g. `mypackage/ext/stuff/mywrappers.pxd`.\r\n\r\nIt works, if you drop `mywrappers.pxd` down one level – but that’s a hack workaround.\r\n\r\nI have created [a GitHub repository](https://github.com/fish2000/language_level) containing a pretty minimalist example demonstrating this bug, with the `language_level=2` setting in `master` and `language_level=3` in another branch, inventively titled `language_level_3`. Here’s how one may readily check the bug:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ cd /tmp\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/fish2000/language_level.git\r\n$ cd language_level/\r\n$ ls -sF\r\n$ ./rebuild # this runs `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`\r\n$ git status # this will show updated code generated by cython\r\n$ git reset --hard\r\n$ git checkout language_level_3 # branch changes `language_level=3`\r\n$ git pull\r\n$ ls -sF\r\n$ more setup.py # you can see the updated `language_level`\r\n$ ./rebuild # This command will die with Cython compile errors!\r\n$ git reset --hard\r\n$ cd ..\r\n$ rm -rf language_level\r\n```\r\n\r\nI first noticed this problem in my own project, [Halogen](https://github.com/fish2000/halogen), which uses Cython; I am stuck on `language_level=2` at the moment because of this.",
