    "body": "A Python subclass should inherit the metaclass from its parent. Currently, Cython fails to support that, at least for Py3-style metaclasses, because it uses different (Py2-like) code when the metaclass is not explicitly provided in the class declaration. The is clearly visible when ```__prepare__``` of the metaclass is not being called for the subclass.\n\nA fix would be to always use code that determines the metaclass by looking at the base classes, regardless of having a Py2-style or Py3-style syntax setup.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/822",
