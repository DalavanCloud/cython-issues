    "body": "There seems to be a problem in the way that cython checks for declarations of `cpdef` overrides of `cdef` methods. It seems that this is related to the feature introduced in https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/545.\r\n\r\nConsider the following `base.pxd`, `base.pyx`, and `bug.pyx`:\r\n```python\r\ncdef class A:\r\n    cdef a(self)\r\n\r\ncdef class B(A):\r\n    pass\r\n    #cpdef a(self)\r\n\r\ncdef class C(B):\r\n    cdef c(self)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\ncdef class A:\r\n    cdef a(self):\r\n        return \"A.a()\"\r\n\r\ncdef class B(A):\r\n    cpdef a(self):\r\n        return \"B.a()\"\r\n\r\ncdef class C(B):\r\n    cdef c(self):\r\n        return \"C.c()\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom base cimport C\r\n\r\ndef call():\r\n    return C().c()\r\n```\r\n\r\nCalling `bug.call()` prints `B.a()`. Enabling the `#cpdef a(self)` fixes the problem, and it prints `C.c()` as expected.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that without the `cpdef`, the vtable used by `bug.pyx` is missing the entry for `B.a`.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, one would probably just have to add a check to Cython so it requires `cpdef` overrides of `cdef` methods to be declared in their `.pxd` files.",
