    "body": "I'm using `mpi4py` to run a code in parallel on a cluster (uses `slurm` for job management, if that matters).  When I run the code on many cores (64) it always fails with an import error (error log attached):\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/n/home00/lkelley/.conda/envs/py35/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pyximport/pyximport.py\", line 217, in load_module\r\n    mod = imp.load_dynamic(name, so_path)\r\n  File \"/n/home00/lkelley/.conda/envs/py35/lib/python3.6/imp.py\", line 342, in load_dynamic\r\n    return _load(spec)\r\nImportError: /n/home00/lkelley/.pyxbld/lib.linux-x86_64-3.6/cy_comp.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so.reload2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I run of few cores (2 & 4) it seems to always work fine.  \r\nOn intermediate numbers of cores (8 & 16) it sometimes fails and sometimes runs (i.e. no code changes, just resubmit the job).\r\n\r\nIt looks like it's trying to store a copy of this `.so` file for each core, but (perhaps because of some sort of race condition) it's failing.  One of our IT people suggested moving everything to the disk which is better optimized for parallel IO -- this sounds like a good suggestion, and one that I'll try, but there seems to be a deeper underlying issue here...  Any suggestions for debugging greatly appreciated!  Thanks.\r\n\r\n[24227339.txt](https://github.com/cython/cython/files/1146383/24227339.txt)\r\n\r\n",
