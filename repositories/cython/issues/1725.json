Hence the (common) use case of building a Cython/numpy extension module with pyximport silently fails with no clear way to debug.\r\n\r\nI am not quite sure who's fault it is. Perhaps Homebrew are at fault for placing a custom distutils.cfg. But as it is, this problem is very difficult to debug. Even a warning regarding the override would be a major improvement.\r\n\r\n# Reproducing\r\n\r\nI'm using the latest homebrewed version of Python (2.7.13) with Cython (0.25.2).\r\n\r\n*testing.py:*\r\nimport pyximport\r\nimport numpy\r\npyximport.install(setup_args={'include_dirs': numpy.get_include()})\r\n\r\nimport testing_pyx\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*testing_pyx.pyx:*\r\nimport cython\r\ncimport numpy\r\n\r\n",
