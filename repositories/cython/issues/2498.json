    "body": "This is an issue to summarize the current status of NumPy C API support and what can/should be done to update Cython. (cc @mattip, this is what I was talking about yesterday - could be a useful thing to work on).\r\n\r\nCurrently Cython uses a NumPy API that has been deprecated since NumPy 1.6.0 in 2013. \r\n- Example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25789055/cython-numpy-warning-about-npy-no-deprecated-api-when-using-memoryview\r\n\r\nThe Cython docs say [here](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/reference/compilation.html): \"For the time being, it is just a warning that you can ignore.\".\r\n\r\nIt is about time to update this, it will save users a lot of confusion and shorten the build logs of many projects by hundreds of lines.\r\n\r\n@nouiz wrote a summary of how to support both old (<1.6.0) and new API: \r\n- https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/2573 (meant as a Cython issue, but never reopened here as far as I can tell)\r\n- https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2013-November/068172.html\r\n\r\nI would suggest that it's either no longer needed to support the old <1.6 API, or make that opt-in rather than the default (to avoid all the build warnings while remaining compatible with very old NumPy versions). Would be good to get the opinion of the Cython team on this before starting work on this.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of changing to the new API and avoiding the build warnings for `scipy.optimize`: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/4351/files. Linking because the use of  ``numpy_nodepr_api`` there (the defines and passing them to `distutils`) may be useful to other projects; it's a bit nontrivial to get right.",
