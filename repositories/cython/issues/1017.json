As this cannot raise any exceptions, it would be nice to reduce the overhead of the try-finally implementation for this case by removing the exception safe/restore code from the ```finally``` block.\n\nThe generated code could be as simple as a 'computed goto' to either the exception handling or normal continuation label after running the code in the finally block.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/456",
