These patches are really small but someone with more \nknowledge may have more or less confidence in them than I:\n\nhttp://hg.cython.org/cython-dagss/rev/b2bcc32021fd\nhttp://hg.cython.org/cython-dagss/rev/a8a9e4c7d5bd\n\nNote that this should fix the CloneNode issue I talked about. (And all \ntests pass btw; yet this is the kind of thing that would cause \nhorrendous failures in obscure cases which are likely not tested for...)\n\nAlso in -dagss I've introduces NewTempExprNode, which is a transitionary \nclass where the temp allocation is moved to code generation. Ideally all \nExprNodes should descend from this one instead (and then it should be \nfolded back into ExprNode to complete the migration).\n\nSome classes fail hard when they are changed to the new scheme. It works \nfor BinOpNode which now uses it. This should allow partial migration. \n(One must make sure a class can work with the new temp allocation scheme \nbefore constructing them in a transform after analysis).",
