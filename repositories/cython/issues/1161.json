This has several drawbacks. For one, we loose the \nlength information, so \"len(s)\" becomes O(n) instead of O(1). Negative \nindexing fails completely because it will use pointer arithmetic, thus \nleaving the allocated memory area of the string. Also, code like the \nfollowing is extremely inefficient because it requires multiple conversions \nfrom a char* of unknown length to a Python bytes object:\n\n     s = b'abc'\n     a = s1 + s\n     b = s2 + s\n\nI came to the conclusion that the right fix is to stop letting byte string \nliterals start off as char*. This immediately fixes these issues and \nimproves Python compatibility while still allowing automatic coercion [...]\n```",
