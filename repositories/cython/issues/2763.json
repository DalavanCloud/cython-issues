            "body": "Hmm. So, there is a feature called \"cimport from pyx\", which can be enabled in the `Cython.Compiler.Options` module, that provides sort-of what you want, but not entirely. I never used it myself, so I can't say how easy it would be to make it work for this case, apart from making it look for `.py` files in addition to `.pyx` files (and then make it interpret correctly what it finds in there).\r\n\r\nHowever, is there any reason for you to not use `.pxd` files? If you want to export certain low-level features from a module, then adding a dedicated file that describes the exported things always seemed like a rather good and explicit approach to me. It's definitely something that works out of the box right now.",
