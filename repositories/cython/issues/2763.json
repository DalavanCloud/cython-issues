    "body": "I'm using Cython 0.29.2 in pure python mode with type hints.\r\n\r\nThe following code snipped works when the two classes are in the same file, but doesn't compile with cython when the two are written in separate files:\r\n```python\r\n# This is in a.py\r\n# cython: language_level=3\r\nimport cython\r\nfrom .b import B\r\n\r\n@cython.cclass\r\nclass A(B):\r\n    @cython.ccall\r\n    def add(self: A, h: cython.int, g: cython.int) -> cython.int:\r\n        return h + g\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    a = A()\r\n    for i in range(100):\r\n        print(a.add(i, i+1))\r\n        print(a.sub(i, i-1))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# This is in b.py\r\n# cython: language_level=3\r\n# cython: language_level=3\r\nimport cython\r\n\r\n@cython.cclass\r\nclass B:\r\n    @cython.ccall\r\n    def sub(self: B, h: cython.int, g: cython.int) -> cython.int:\r\n        return h - g\r\n```\r\n\r\nI couldn't find in the documentation a proper way (decorator?) to handle such an issue.\r\nThe cython compiler gives the error `First base of 'A' is not an extension type` which I think is false, since it is also declared as cclass and when the two are in the same module everything works.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is:\r\n- a bug (should cython recognize the imports?)\r\n- a feature request (maybe it is not currently possible to do such thing in cython?)\r\n- a documentation request (I couldn't find in in any place in the documentation, which btw also don't really mentions how to use cython with type hints).\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.",
