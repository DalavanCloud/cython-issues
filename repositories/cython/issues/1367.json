    "body": "Compiling Cython-generated C++ code on Solaris with recent versions of GCC breaks because `__STDC_VERSION__` is defined to be `199901L`, even though the C99 \"restrict\" keyword isn't supported.\n\nI filed a GCC bug about this: [http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57025]\nBut strictly speaking, `__STDC_VERSION__` has no meaning in C++ code, so it's a bug to rely on its value.\n\nI propose (see patch) to use `__restrict__` if `__GNUC__` is defined: then there are benefits on all systems when using GCC to compile Cython-generated C++ code and it fixes this bug.\n\nAt 2013-04-21T15:01:56Z @jdemeyer added attachment [restrict.patch](https://gist.github.com/6e7796c87c7683366eb102cd3f9a0c64)\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/809",
