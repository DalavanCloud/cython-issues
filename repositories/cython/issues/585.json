Reopening but making it a minor wishlist issue.\n\nDetails:\n```\nDoes anyone have any thoughts about the external typedef issue with \nargument unpacking? I see that with Stefan's code we get an exception \nrather than a segfault which is a big step forward, but one could still \nthink a bit about what the behaviour should be (i.e. if people wants to \nuse numpy.uint16_t as a function argument type I want a defined \nbehaviour for that.)\n\nExample:\n\ntest.h:\ntypedef long int my_int;\n\ntest.pyx:\n\ncdef extern from \"test.h\":\n    ctypedef char myint\n\ndef myfunc(myint x):\n    pass\n\nNow, myfunc(1000) will raise an overflow exception.\n\nGranted, this is an extreme example. I just want a defined behaviour on \nthis somehow, and documenting the existing one could be ok. If we want \nto support it without assumptions on the size, something like\n\n#define __Pyx_FetchPyInt(result, from) switch(sizeof(result)) {\\\n  case sizeof(char): result = __pyx_PyInt_char(from); break;\n  case sizeof(int):\n  ....\n   default: __Pyx_RaiseFetchPyIntError(from); result = -1;\n}\n\nshould do the trick (and it is only needed when the typedef is extern). \nWill a patch like that be accepted? (It will have to wait a month or two \nif I'm the one doing it, but I am not expecting anybody else to in the \nmeantime.)\n```",
