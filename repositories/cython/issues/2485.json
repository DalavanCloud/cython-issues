            "body": "When I read this, it made me wonder how NumPy represents an `ndarray` of `object` type. My naive thought would be that it is an `ndarray` filled with `PyObject*`s under the hood. IOW it doesn't own the Python objects, but it shares them with the interpreter, which may use them elsewhere. If that's true, it means that a readonly Python object array only means the array must always point to the same objects in the same order, but the objects themselves are free to change. Meaning that a readonly object array is something very different than any other kind of readonly array.\r\n\r\nWe could probably confirm this by talking to a NumPy expert or diving into the source code. Came up with the follow quick test code instead.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [1]: import sys\r\n\r\nIn [2]: import numpy as np\r\n\r\nIn [3]: l = 10 * [5]\r\n\r\nIn [4]: a = np.empty((1,), dtype=object)\r\n\r\nIn [5]: a[0] = l\r\n\r\nIn [6]: ar = a.copy()\r\n\r\nIn [7]: ar.setflags(write=False)\r\n\r\nIn [8]: sys.getsizeof(l)\r\nOut[8]: 144\r\n\r\nIn [9]: sys.getsizeof(a)\r\nOut[9]: 104\r\n\r\nIn [10]: sys.getsizeof(ar)\r\nOut[10]: 104\r\n\r\nIn [11]: ar[0] = 10 * [3]\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n<ipython-input-11-a295c4b70dc9> in <module>()\r\n----> 1 ar[0] = 10 * [3]\r\n\r\nValueError: assignment destination is read-only\r\n\r\nIn [12]: ar\r\nOut[12]: array([list([5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5])], dtype=object)\r\n\r\nIn [13]: l[3] = 2\r\n\r\nIn [14]: ar\r\nOut[14]: array([list([5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5])], dtype=object)\r\n\r\nIn [15]: ar[0][0] = None\r\n\r\nIn [16]: ar\r\nOut[16]: array([list([None, 5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5])], dtype=object)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere are the observations one can draw from this. First the size of a NumPy object array does not seem to include the size of the Python objects in it. Thus suggesting the NumPy object array merely contains `PyObject*`s and does not hold the memory for these objects. Second one cannot overwrite objects in the readonly NumPy object array, which supports the idea it contains `PyObject*`s. Third one can easily change objects within a readonly NumPy array by manipulating the objects it contains. This can even be done using the readonly NumPy object array itself. Thus the NumPy array has no influence over these Python objects. It wouldn't surprise me if Cython memoryviews are implemented similarly under the hood.\r\n\r\nGiven this, it makes me wonder, is this the behavior one would expect/want from `const object[:]`?",
