    "body": "There is no way to declare a C++ class that inherits from a template class yet. The following code will raise syntax error:\n\n```\nfrom libcpp.vector import vector\ncdef extern from \"foo.h\":\n    cdef cppclass VectOfInt(vector[int])\n```\n\nThe attached patch could fix this. But the patch needs review and cleanup since I'm unsure about the correctness.\n\nAt 2010-07-05T06:52:43Z @bhy added attachment [cppclass_template_base.patch](https://gist.github.com/226ade88de25e8536394e33243b57e4c)\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/552",
