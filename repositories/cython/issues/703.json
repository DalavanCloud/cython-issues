    "body": "In summer 2008, I moved the things that ```BlockNode``` was made for doing over to ```code.funcstate```. However, things are a bit ugly: Constants/literals are recorded in ```env``` during analysis, then each function environment pipes the literals to ```code.funcstate``` (possibly making duplicate reports from the ```env```), which again makes efforts to merge duplicate entries.\n\nThis is ugly, and I'm not guaranteeing that it is working 100% either.\n\nOne side-effect is that if literals cannot be added in tree transformations, and if you remove literals in transformations then it is still allocated etc.\n\nThe best fix is to move registration of literals/constants over to code generation phase (modifying ```code.funcstate``` along the way). This can be done one literal type at the time, nice and incrementally. When all is done, ```BlockNode``` can be deleted.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/144",

The only exception is the builtins cache, which remains inside the scoping infrastructure (for now), as there is no technical need to move it.\n\nTwo problems remain:\n\n * ```CArrayDeclaratorNode``` needs the array size at type analysis time. In the case of a C compile time constant expression (such as \"C_CONST_VAL+3\"), there is currently no way to retrieve a string for the size. This is tested in ```carrays.pax```.\n\n * Some ```PyrexType```s have a ```create_convert_utility_code()``` method that dynamically generates a UtilityCode instance during type analysis. If this requires constant allocation (such as in ```CStructOrUnionType```), this cannot be done before the code generation phase.\n\nBoth of these need fixing as they break previously working code.",
