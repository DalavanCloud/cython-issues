    "body": "Measuring and reporting the coverage of the Cython module does not appear to be working correctly in the case of this package ( https://github.com/jakirkham/cyminmax/commit/675f86170ac89891a3fd56f169fa9003eb50102c ). In particular, an error is seen when reporting the coverage and trying to submit it. This occurs on both Python 2 and Python 3. Details from the report and submission failures are included below. Links to relevant CI logs are included in the details. While the errors may initially appear to be unrelated, both issues share the same cause on local inspection. On the surface, the problem seems to share a similar cause to issue ( https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/1898 ).
