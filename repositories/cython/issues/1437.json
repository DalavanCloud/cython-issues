    "body": "If the cython .pyd-file containing a function with fused types is inside a package hierarchy, the Python importlib seems to search for the function at each call (importlib._bootstrap._find_and_load()). This creates a huge runtime overhead.\n\nIt must be an issue with the combination of fused datatypes, packages and the new Python 3 importlib.\nThe problem does not occur if:\n- the .pyd file is not inside a package hierarchy\n- standard datatypes, e.g., double, are used instead of fused types. For standard datatypes, it does not matter whether the .pyd file is inside the package hierarchy or not.\n- Python 2.7 is used instead of 3.3\n\nA minimal example is attached as a zip.\n\n\n----\nConfiguration:\nCython 0.22\nPython 3.3\nNumpy 1.9.2\nWindows 7 64 bit\n\nAt 2015-04-20T10:20:34Z **yanlend** added attachment [cython_example.zip](https://gist.github.com/992824fd6189d07ed0e1fb3fd1e82ec0)\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/847",
