It basically runs through the array of pointers that underlies the MRO tuple and compares the pointers with the type pointer in question. The MRO tuple should usually fit into a single cache line, so the whole algorithm should finish within a few CPU cycles for reasonably sized inheritance hierarchies.\n\nIs there any special case that you want to see optimised? Otherwise, I don't think there's much you could do better.",
