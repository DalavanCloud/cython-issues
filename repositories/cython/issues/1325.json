OpenMP tests should be skipped with the clang compiler\n2.  Replace self-assignment hack to avoid unused parameter warnings with CYTHON_UNUSED\n3. __Pyx_Method_ClassMethod sometimes included unnecessarily\n4. Make runtests.py display the commands it is executing\n\nPlease see the comments by Stefan Behnel in the mailing list thread.\n\nAttached find complete Cython build and test logs for 5fcc3e2e051e04fea2cf6d07cd0de94c1e11dca8 for Mac OS X Lion with Xcode 4.3.\nThe test failures are still there, the compiler warnings changed a bit in the meantime, especially I think there are quite a few new unused function warnings.\n\nGiven that clang is getting more and more common (default compiler on the Mac) and finds issues gcc doesn't, would it be possible to include clang on the Cython build / test server (this was mentioned as a possibility by Stefan in the mailing list thread)?\nIf not I would be of course happy to re-run any builds / tests to diagnose these issues.\n\nThank you for developing Cython!\n\nAt 2012-04-22T22:03:20Z **deil** added attachment [cython-build.log](https://gist.github.com/541ee754a359bbcd805aeefadadd86c4)\n\nAt 2012-04-22T22:03:52Z **deil** added attachment [cython-tests.log](https://gist.github.com/71acbeff8f353504632b8180871ba0a1)\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/770\n",
