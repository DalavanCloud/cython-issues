    "body": "Am attempting to compile complex legacy code with cython (for speed) and am running into warnings in the generated .c code\n\n\nGiven the following:\n```\nimport sys\n\ncdef class Foo(object):\n     def __init(self, log):\n         self.log = log\n\n     def bar(self):\n         def inner(a):\n             return self.log.write(str(a))\n\n         self.log = sys.stdout\n         inner(42)\n```\n\ncython-0.13 and latest cython-devel handles it, but I get compilation warnings from gcc on compiling the generated .c code:\n```\n$ cython innerfunction.pyx\n$ gcc -I/usr/include/python2.6 -lpython2.6 innerfunction.c\ninnerfunction.c: In function ‘__pyx_pf_13innerfunction_3Foo_bar’:\ninnerfunction.c:547: warning: assignment from incompatible pointer type\ninnerfunction.c:575: warning: passing argument 1 of ‘PyObject_SetAttr’ from incompatible pointer type\n/usr/include/python2.6/object.h:472: note: expected ‘struct PyObject *’ but argument is of type ‘struct __pyx_obj_13innerfunction_Foo *’\n```\n\nThe error in question at line 547 is on this line:\n```\n  __pyx_cur_scope->__pyx_v_self = __pyx_v_self;\n```\nwhere:\n```\nstruct __pyx_obj_13innerfunction___pyx_scope_struct_bar {\n  PyObject_HEAD\n  PyObject *__pyx_v_inner;\n  struct __pyx_obj_13innerfunction_Foo *__pyx_v_self;\n};\n```\n\nand the locals are:\n```\n  PyObject *__pyx_v_self\n  struct __pyx_obj_13innerfunction___pyx_scope_struct_bar *__pyx_cur_scope;\n```\n\nso the closure struct has a ptr to the underlying struct class, whereas self is a PyObject*\n\n\nSimilarly, at line 575, we have:\n```\n  if (PyObject_SetAttr(__pyx_cur_scope->__pyx_v_self, __pyx_n_s__log, __pyx_t_2) < 0)\n```\n\nwhere the compiler is unhappy with the passing of the subclass*, rather than a PyObject*\n\n\nObviously these are safely cast-able in both cases, but it would be nicer to avoid compilation warnings.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/573",
