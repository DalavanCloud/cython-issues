    "body": "When running under Python 3, any .py file that pyximport is triggered for can be expected to be in Python 3 syntax. Currently, pyximporting simply fails because of syntax errors because it does not configure the language level at all. Therefore, pyximport's import hook should automatically switch to -3 mode under Python 3 when compiling a .py file.\n\nNote that the same is not true for .pyx files, which may or may not in Py3 syntax. So there should additionally be a way to configure the language level explicitly when installing the pyximport import hooks.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/733",
