(So the iterable happens to be None.)\n\nThe name of the iterable (or rather the entire iterable expression) must be evaluated in the outer scope.\ncommented\n\nActually, it's even different - CPython simply pre-evaluates the outermost iterable when creating the generator. Example (Py3.2):\n\n```\n>>> x = [g = (i for x in x for i in x)\n>>> list(g)\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9](range(10)]\n>>>)\n\n>>> x = [g = (i for i in range(5) for x in x)\n>>> list(g)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <genexpr>\nUnboundLocalError: local variable 'x' referenced before assignment\n```\nSo, basically, the outermost iterable should be evaluated into a closure variable of the generator, instead of letting the generator evaluate it itself. This:\n```\nx = [range(10)](range(10)]\n>>>)\ng = (i for x in x for i in x)\n```\nshould be transformed into\n```\nx = [range(10)]\n\ndef _gen(_outer_it):\n    for x in _outer_it:\n        for i in x:\n            yield i\n\ng = _gen(x)\n```",
