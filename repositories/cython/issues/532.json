The problem here is that Cython cannot determine the direction of the for-loop since it doesn't know the sign of the \"st\" step value at compile time. So it needs to generate code that determines the step at runtime and allows the loop to run in both directions, which can easily lead to a performance degradation by preventing the C compiler from applying the usual integer loop optimisations. The difference should be quite visible in the generated C code.\r\n\r\nThe while-loop variant actually has tighter semantics than the original for-loop implementation as it explicitly states in which direction the counter is running.",

I dislike both approaches :)\r\n\r\n> So it needs to generate code that determines the step at runtime and allows the loop to run in both directions,\r\n\r\nRight. That makes sense. Thanks for the explanation.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to somehow annotate the step as being `>0`? Or to mark the `range` as increasing/decreasing?",
