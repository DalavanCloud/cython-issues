    "body": "The ref-counting for parallel swap assignments is redundant, i.e.\n```\ncdef object a = ..., b = ...\na,b = b,a\n```\nshould be a simple pointer exchange through a temp variable. The same applies to swapping list or buffer items. The general rules are:\n\n * the sets of names/expressions on both sides must be identical\n * no value must appear more than once on either side, i.e. this must be prohibited: ```a,b,b = a,a,b```\n * all values on both sides of an assignment must have Python object types\n * attribute access is only allowed at the C level, i.e. no Python attributes or properties\n * item access (indexing) is only allowed for C types, including buffers and Python lists\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/425",
