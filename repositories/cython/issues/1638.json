    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI encountered a problem with my compiled code: the memory is leaking with each call to the cpdef function. Memory profiling shows lots of memoryview objects remaining.\r\n\r\nGoogling quickly found a couple of similar bug reports, some of them pretty old. The main one, I think, is this one: https://www.mail-archive.com/cython-devel@python.org/msg03817.html\r\n\r\nI checked the attached test there — the latest Cython 0.25.2 is leaking as well. \r\n\r\nPlease advise how to avoid this — my Cython functions are executed thousands to millions of times and 200 MB program grows to >10 GB because of the leak. \r\n\r\n[leaktest.tar.gz](https://github.com/cython/cython/files/854911/leaktest.tar.gz)\r\n",
