They are create on the fly.\n\nLooking at tests results it seems to work just fine.",

Note that \"classic\" isn't a very explicit name.\n\n * it lacks a test for inner functions that don't need a closure\n\n * it lacks a test for inner functions whose names end up in the closure themselves\n\n * ```callable()``` is not supported in Py3 (even if that may get reverted in the future), just test for ```isinstance(x, (int, list))``` instead\n\n * I prefer letting test classes inherit from object, old-style classes are ugly and evil\n\n * I'd use a keyword argument in Nodes.py to make it clearer what the ```not self.is_wrapper``` means in this context\n\n * ```pretty_name``` seems to be used only for lambda functions, so I think it's a separate change that's unrelated to this patch. I'm not sure, but I think that the name chosen in Code.py should depend explicitly on the ```is_lambda``` flag and the common functionality that you need for redefined functions and lambda functions should not depend on ```is_lambda``` but a more explicitly named flag (not sure ATM what that functionality is, so I can't suggest a better name)",
