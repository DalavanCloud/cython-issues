So the proposal is: If the iterator in a for-loop calls a cdef function, inspect whether there is a) only one possible return value outside of any branches, and b) if it is a Cython \"magic loop function\". If so, inline it in Cython.\n\n(There's always the danger of this being too magic *shrug*)\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/182",
