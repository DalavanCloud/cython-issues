    "body": "With the 'profile' option enabled, Cython raises a compile error when it finds a 'nogil' function, claiming that it cannot generate profiling code for it. This shouldn't even be worth a warning. Currently, users have to explicitly disable profiling for each nogil function, which is cumbersome. Most users will easily understand it if nogil functions do not turn up in a Python profiling statistic.\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/652",
