    "body": "I am trying to use processor's `DEF` inside `IF`. I have asked this question [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45156510/preprocessor-def-can-not-be-conditioned-inside-if-elif-and-else-statement-in-cy) as well. The equivalent code in C of what I am trying to write is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#define A 1\r\n#if A == 1\r\n    #define B 2\r\n#else\r\n    #define B 3\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\nIn above `B` should be `2`, whereas it gives `3` if I write it in Cython. Here is a sample:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# in Definitions.pxi\r\nDEF A=1\r\nIF A==1:\r\n    DEF B=2\r\n    print('B should be 2.')\r\nELSE:\r\n    DEF B=3\r\n    print('B should be 3.')\r\n```\r\nand \r\n```\r\n# In test.pyx\r\ninclude \"Definitions.pxi\"\r\nprint('B is: %d'%B)\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\n# In setup.py\r\nfrom distutils.core import setup\r\nfrom distutils.extension import Extension\r\nfrom Cython.Build import cythonize\r\nsetup(name = \"test\",ext_modules = cythonize(Extension(\"*\",[\"test.pyx\"])))\r\n```\r\nNow, testing it:\r\n```\r\n>>> ipython\r\nIn [1]: %reload_ext Cython\r\nIn [2]: import test\r\n\r\nB should be 2\r\nB is: 3\r\n```\r\nIt seems that the very last `DEF` statement is being used and all `IF` as well as `ELIF` and `ELSE` are ignored.  I am wondering if this is a bug or I am not using it correctly.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

            "body": "Interesting case. Semantically, the code you wrote does not mean what you intended. Instead, ``IF`` means: if the condition is true, then include its *code block* in the compilation. By design, ``DEF`` does not belong into the code block, because it is *evaluated* at compile time, not *included* at compile time. ``DEF`` is a compile time thing and not controlled by conditions itself. Meaning, both ``DEF`` assignments are being evaluated, in code order, and the last one survives and goes into the execution of the ``print()``.\r\n\r\nNow, the fix could go either way: either implement a control flow for ``DEF`` inside of conditionals, or disallow indented ``DEF``s. I'm slightly leaning towards the latter since it's not really clear to me that the first is a feature worth having. These compile time expressions have a tendency to be generally overused...",
