    "body": "Once you know about python's `trashcan` that is used in its dealloc methods and that cython does not make use of it, it's not hard to cause a crash in deallocation of a cython class:\n```\ncython(\"\"\"\ncdef class A(object):\n    cdef object ref\n    def __init__(self,ref):\n        self.ref = ref\n\n\"\"\")\n``` \nA long linked list of these will quickly exhaust the C-stack (set a ulimit on the stack if you have a lot of memory):\n```\nprint \"allocating a\"\na=A(None)\nfor i in range(10**6):\n    a=A(a)\n\nprint \"deleting a\"\ndel a\nprint \"done deleting a\"\n```\n\nOnce you interleave with a python container type (tuple, for instance), the trashcan starts to kick in. The following runs without problem.\n```\nb=A(None)\nprint \"allocating b\"\nfor i in range(10**6):\n    b=A((b,))\n\nprint \"deleting b\"\ndel b\nprint \"done deleting b\"\n```\nThis issue came up as a side issue on http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/13896. The trashcan is a rather complicated thing to get working right. In particular, cython must take precautions to ensure that once deallocation is started on an object, it isn't put into the trashcan in deallocs of base types.\n\nThis is also sage http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/13901\n\nMigrated from http://trac.cython.org/ticket/797",
