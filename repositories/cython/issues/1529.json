    "body": "I observed a compilation error from clang-800.0.38 on a MacBook when using a c enum and a Cython cpdef enum. I could reproduce the issue using gcc version 4.9.2 (Raspbian 4.9.2-10). In both cases, Cython version 0.25.1 was used.\r\n\r\n**The code I ran was:**\r\n```\r\n#lib.h\r\ntypedef enum { A, B, C, D} foo;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n#lib.pyx\r\ncdef extern from \"./lib.h\":\r\n    cpdef enum foo:\r\n        A, B, C, D\r\n\r\ndef t1():\r\n    for e in foo: print(e.name)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen trying to compile, clang throws a lot of errors which all seem to correlate with the \"enum foo\".\r\nA solution is to declare the enum in the .h file as following `typedef enum foo { A, B, C, D} foo;`or as `typedef enum foo { A, B, C, D};`. When changed, the code is compiled and linked to a .so file and is working as intended.\r\n\r\nIs this intended behaviour or bug?",
