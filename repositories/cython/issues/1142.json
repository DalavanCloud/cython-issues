Following rationale and patch may be completely wrong, but now the attached test case works.\n\nI've found out that when AlignFunctionDefinitions.visit_DefNode() from ParseTreeTransforms.py adjusts type of self argument of a method, the change propagates to unexpected places, because function type, its argument list and first argument type instances are shared with other DefNodes. A couple of copy()s fixed this. (I don't know why it is shared in the first place - fixing that could be much more correct than this)\n\nThis patch has a problem that it causes that function call is typed to base type a bit too match. Also, Py3 case is completely untested.
