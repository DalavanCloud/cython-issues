    "body": "Cython 0.29.5 includes 7c377902d5a5e23cc02a74643af0c098492c845a which suppresses a warning via GCC diagnostic pragmas.  However, since [GCC introduced support for diagnostic pragmas in GCC 4.6](https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc-4.6/changes.html), the presence of these pragmas leads to compilation errors on RHEL/CentOS 6 when using the default GCC 4.4.x compiler.\r\n\r\nPlease consider only using GCC diagnostic pragmas if GCC â‰¥ 4.6 so that Cython may continue to be used on RHEL/CentOS 6 systems.\r\n\r\nI'll submit a PR shortly, but please be aware I haven't written a line of C code in over 5 years.  ðŸ˜€",
