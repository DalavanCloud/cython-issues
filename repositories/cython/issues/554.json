    "body": "inline quasi JIT/AOC (through cython.inline, scipy.weave) offers the ability to do an simple but heavily optimized compilation, like with OpenCL. But part of squeezing every ounce of performance out of a module and keeping the modules/fragment code simple is using macro based defines (-DVAR=value) to pass type information as well as constants (say matrix dimensions).  It would be best if this was done in cross platform.\r\n\r\nI intend to submit a patch soon for at least passing compiler options through the inline function, which allows the same result, although one must know the compiler to pass the define option correctly.",
