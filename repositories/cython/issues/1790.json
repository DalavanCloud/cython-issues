Previously, we were just returning it with no conversions, and this was fine; it would be converted to a list of `unicode` (in accordance with the directives in our .pyx files). With .26, however, the behavior has changed, but only in Python 3's prior to 3.6; now, 3.5.3 returns a list of `bytes`, while 3.6 returns a list of `unicode`.\r\n\r\nI did a bisect and narrow it down to somewhere at or around https://github.com/cython/cython/commit/6cd70f0914d327f21feb8535810414c12e021737. My guess was that it's because this `X_to_py` function is no longer being called, but getting much deeper than that dives into implementation territory that I'm not familiar with.\r\n\r\nIs this expected behavior?",
