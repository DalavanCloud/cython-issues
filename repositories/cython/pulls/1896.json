An early include is put in the Cython-generated `.c` file *before* Cython's declarations, a late include is put *after* Cython's declarations.\r\n\r\nWhile #1650 proposed new syntax to classify an include as late, this pull request determines it automatically as follows: if a `cdef extern from \"foo.h\"` block is not empty and contains only variable or function declarations, then it is considered late. If it is empty, or it contains some kind of type declaration, then it is early.\r\n\r\nCC @embray",
