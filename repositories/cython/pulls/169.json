    "body": "This issue was first reported on [cython-devel](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/cython-devel/2012-August/003068.html) but could not be resolved at that time. It leads to crashes in the Cython test suite.\r\n\r\nThe following extension, a reduced example, is expected to print `1`. When compiled with msvc9 compiler for 64 bit using default compiler options, it prints `2`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom cython.view cimport array as cvarray\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\ncdef int[:] a = np.zeros((1, ), 'int32')\r\ncdef int[:] b = a[:1]\r\nprint(b.shape[0])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tracked it down to [Utility/MemoryView.pyx#L839](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/Cython/Utility/MemoryView.pyx#L839). In that context `(1 - 0) % 1` is computed to `1`.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the modulo operator by multiplication and subtraction. This fixes the issue and all unit tests pass, without crash, on win-amd64-py2.7.\r\n\r\nThere's another potential 64 bit Windows specific issue at [Utility/MemoryView_C.c#L516](https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/master/Cython/Utility/MemoryView_C.c#L516):\r\nA `ssize_t` value is converted to a Python Integer (32 bit on win-amd64 platform), possibly losing data. It would be better to use the `PyLong_FromSsize_t` function instead of `PyInt_FromLong`, however `PyLong_FromSsize_t` is only available for Python >= 2.6.",
