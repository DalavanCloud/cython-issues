    "body": "It's well known that the order of libraries matters when linking:\r\n```\r\ngcc ... -lfoo -lbar ...\r\n```\r\nis not the same as\r\n```\r\ngcc ... -lbar -lfoo ...\r\n```\r\n(for some reason, this matters particularly much for Cygwin)\r\n\r\nHowever, when multiple libraries are declared in Cython using\r\n```\r\n# distutils: libraries = foo\r\n```\r\nin multiple .pxd files, there is no real guarantee what the final library order will be. So we need a mechanism to sort the list of libraries. I propose a new option `libraries_sort_key` which is used to sort the list of libraries. The default sort key is `lambda x:0`, which means that nothing will change since Python's sort is stable.\r\n\r\nSage already has a mechanism to do this by changing the extensions before feeding them to distutils. However, it would be better to make this part of Cython (such that the order also appears correctly in the JSON metadata dump).",
