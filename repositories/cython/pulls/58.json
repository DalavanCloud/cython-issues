When the source is checked out from a git clone,\nthe .gitrev file does not exist, but the '$(shell cat .gitrev)' sequence is\nexecuted every time make is called and it produces an error message.  Also,\nthe '$(shell mktemp -d tmprepo.XXXXXX)' sequence is  executed every time\nmake is called, which creates a new unique tmprepo.XXXXXX directory each\ntime.\n\nSo, let's rework this target so that the := notation is avoided, and also\nto make it a little more efficient by avoiding an unnecessary checkout of\nthe repository.\n\nThere are two functional changes: 1) the temporary directory will just be\ncalled \".repo_tmp\" and it will be overwritten each time 'make repo' is\ncalled, and 2) the checked out branch will keep its default name rather\nthan adopting a new name 'working'.  The user can create a new branch if\nthey desire and the original remote branch state is already available in\norigin/master.",
