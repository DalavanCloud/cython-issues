    "body": "This pull request adds a new `dynamic_attributes` directive to Cython. It will give `cdef` classes a `__dict__`, which will let you dynamically add properties to instances of them from Python. Opt-in, because it's got a performance penalty on classes that use it. (I can't find it again, but I found a message on the mailing list with benchmarks showing significant performance hits for `cpdef` functions if a class has a __dict__).\r\n\r\nA compile test has also been added.",
