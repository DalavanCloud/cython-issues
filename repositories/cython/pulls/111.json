In the test, a char* is taken from a global variable, which Cython only looks up temporarily. I think it would be good to do something about this in general and I consider a visible warning an appropriate measure. Here's an example of such broken code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    s = b\"abc\"\r\n\r\n    def change_s():\r\n        global s\r\n        s = b\"bcd\"   # deallocates previous object\r\n\r\n    def broken():\r\n        cdef char* c = s\r\n        change_s()\r\n        print(c)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same applies to threading, where the GIL might get released unexpectedly when calling back into the interpreter, and other threads can change the global variable.",
