    "body": "`python_requires` is a [relatively new setuptools.setup keyword](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/pull/631), which can be used by pip (and others) to determine which versions of python a release supports. This is useful when cython drops older versions of python, so that pip only tries to install releases which support the current version of python. Numpy has merged support for this in https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/8949, and it'd be useful for projects using cython for cython to include this (my reason for wanting this is to make h5py's installation more robust).",
