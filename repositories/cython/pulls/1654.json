The `foo.pxd` file contains `cdef extern from \"header.h\"` where `header.h` is installed in `.../python/site-packages/foo/header.h`\r\n\r\nWhen another package Bar wants to `cimport foo.foo`, the `cdef extern from \"header.h\"` will become `#include \"header.h\"` in the C file. The problem is now that the C compiler will not be able to find this file.\r\n\r\nThe solution is obvious: whenever we look for a `cdef extern from` file, we add its directory to the `include_dirs` of the extension.",
