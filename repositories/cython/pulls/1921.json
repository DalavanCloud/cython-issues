In particular I have observed the following four errors:\r\n\r\n- CAlg pathing has changed\r\n- The \".pyx\" files do not build without addition compiler directive \r\n- The module does not run without setting $LD_LIBRARY_PATH\r\n- The proposed testing command python -c 'import queue.Queue as Q ; Q()' does not work anymore\r\n\r\nI have adapted the totural to work with the newest Cython version and tested the whole process step-by-step. Some additional helpfull instructions for people new to Cython are also added.\r\n\r\nAdditional note: I have only reviewed my amendments on github. I was not able to build the entire documentation to see how the final result will look on 'readthedocs' once the documentation has been compiled to '.html'. Could someone hint me how I can compile the docs myself to see how the final result looks like myself?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
