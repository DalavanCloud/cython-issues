I've finally got to update my configuration on a different host and the fact it didn't work became obvious.\r\n\r\nHere's a fix.\r\n\r\nIf anyone fancies testing it to avoid falling for the same mistake, here's the command to do that (provided you have Emacs installed):\r\n```bash\r\n$ emacs -Q -l Tools/cython-mode.el Cython/Utility/CppConvert.pyx\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt also looks like that some of the (rather) new keywords, such as `fused` or `cppclass` are not supported, should I add them in this PR or in a new one?",
