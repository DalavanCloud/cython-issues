    "body": "## Motivation\n\nIn my project, [openage](https://github.com/sfttech/openage), the build system does absolute-path compiler invocations, which leads to excessively long and redundant Cython exception traceback messages like this one (newlines inserted for readability):\n\n```\nFile \"openage/cppinterface/setup_checker.pyx\", line 12,\nin openage.cppinterface.setup_checker.check\n(/home/mic/git/openage/openage/cppinterface/setup_checker.cpp:662)\n```\n## PR\n\nSo I added an option, `Cython.Compiler.Options.short_cfilenm`, which, if set to a non-None value, replaces the expression that's used to generate the C filename in the exception traceback:\n\n```\nfrom Cython.Compiler import Options\nOptions.short_cfilenm = '\"cpp\"'\nfrom Cython.Build import cythonize\ncythonize(...)\n```\n\nAfter this, the traceback message is a much more pleasant, entirely redundancy-free\n\n```\nFile \"openage/cppinterface/setup_checker.pyx\", line 12,\nin openage.cppinterface.setup_checker.check (cpp:662)\n```\n\nFor now, the option is not exposed via the CLI, because I didn't know whether that would be desirable.\nIf documentation is needed, please point me at the file I need to edit.\n",
