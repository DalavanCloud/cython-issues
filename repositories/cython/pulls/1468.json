    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks for this great project.\r\n\r\nIn some cases I'm interested in distributing an sdist which contains original .py/.pyx files and not the cythonized versions (.c)\r\nWhen I know the users have cython it make the setup.py more simple, no need to handle the case cython present/not present ([example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4505747/how-should-i-structure-a-python-package-that-contains-cython-code))\r\n\r\nSo I thought about adding an option \"keep_sources\" to ```cythonize``` so that it doesn't replace python sources by c sources in the module objects. This lets sdist use the original py/pyx files.\r\n\r\nExample of usage: https://gist.github.com/piec/adc5b81f21672f311c0fe2425bd67622\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n---\r\n**Edit:** Alternative options in the [documentation](http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/reference/compilation.html#distributing-cython-modules)\r\n * \"no_cythonize\" which would work I suppose but is a bit ugly to add to many packages\r\n * This kind of thing\r\n```\r\n    extensions = [Extension(\"*\", [\"*.pyx\"])],\r\n    cmdclass={'build_ext': Cython.Build.build_ext},\r\n```\r\nThe sdist is fine but I couldn't get a bdist working [gist](https://gist.github.com/piec/5d93b97b89aa229e48dda0001e4402a1) I think ```Extension(\"*\", ...)``` is only valid in a ```cythonize(...)``` call",
