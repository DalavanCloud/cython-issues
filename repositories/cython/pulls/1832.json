    "body": "This should fix #1731, but it changes a couple of things in the exception handling that I'm uncertain about.\r\n\r\nOne is that it seems necessary to keep the closure alive until the coroutine (or generator) is being cleaned up since it might still need it when handling the `GeneratorExit` exception. I enabled that by disabling the `tp_clear` slot of generator closures (although that does not mean that their parent closure also stays valid), which might introduce cases of hard reference cycles between the coroutine and its closure that cannot be cleared at all.\r\n\r\nAlso, I find it difficult to figure out what CPython actually does exactly when handling exceptions inside and outside of coroutines, because the code is split across the eval loop, the frame handling, and the generator code. I tried my best to make the behaviour closer to what I think should happen, but I'm not sure I actually got there. At least, there are more test cases now than before and this change fixes them, which suggests that it is at least better in those cases. But I also had to change a test case (`generator_frame_cycle.py`) that previously did not need GC in the case of a reference cycle but now does. I actually don't know why it worked before - it should have crashed, and I added a second test case to it that shows that it at least handled the exception state incorrectly before.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to get a second pair of eyes on this. I think it's more correct than before in some ways, but it feels like I missed something...",
