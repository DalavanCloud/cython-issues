    "body": "This pull request adds very basic support for metaclasses in extension types, using this syntax:\r\n\r\n```cython\r\ncdef class MyType(type):\r\n    pass\r\ncdef class MyClass:\r\n    cdef MyType __metaclass__\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is equivalent to doing `PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT(&MyType, 0)` in a `PyTypeObject` declaration.\r\n\r\nSubclasses can declare a different type for ``__metaclass__`` if their base class has one already unlike with normal attributes - but restrictions on metaclass inheritance like in normal Python have been put in place.\r\n\r\nMore info has been added to the docs.\r\n\r\n# Implementation information\r\n\r\nNormally the `tp_new` and `tp_init` of an extension type's `ob_base` doesn't get called, which could result in crashes if a metaclass has custom fields declared as the `__cinit__` doesn't get called. So a little helper function called `__Pyx_MetaclassInit` has been added which takes advantage of the fact you can call `tp_new` with one argument.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass MyType(type):\r\n    def __new__(*args):\r\n        print(\"__new__ was called\")\r\n        return type.__new__(*args)\r\nclass MyClass(metaclass=MyType): pass\r\n\r\n# \"__new__ was called\" gets printed to the console again\r\nMyType(MyClass)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt gets called during the execution code phase rather than the type init phase in case the `__cinit__`/`__init__` methods depends on any global variables. `__prepare__` is not called at all from the Cython side of things (not sure if it's needed)\r\n\r\nThe `cdef dict __dict__` extensible type feature has been adjusted to work on metaclasses, meaning that you can also use this feature to make your extension types \"moneypatch-able\".",
