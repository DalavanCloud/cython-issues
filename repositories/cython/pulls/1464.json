So a little helper function called `__Pyx_MetaclassInit` has been added which takes advantage of the fact you can call `tp_new` with one argument.\n\n``` python\nclass MyType(type):\n    def __new__(*args):\n        print(\"__new__ was called\")\n        return type.__new__(*args)\nclass MyClass(metaclass=MyType): pass\n\n# \"__new__ was called\" gets printed to the console again\nMyType(MyClass)\n```\n\nIt gets called during the execution code phase rather than the type init phase in case the `__cinit__`/`__init__` methods depends on any global variables. `__prepare__` is not called at all from the Cython side of things (not sure if it's needed)\n\nThe `cdef dict __dict__` extensible type feature has been adjusted to work on metaclasses, meaning that you can also use this feature to make your extension types \"moneypatch-able\".\n",
