    "body": "Using Cython-0.17b3 on Windows with msvc9 and msvc10 compilers, several parralel prange tests fail sometimes, but not always. E.g.:\n\n```\nFile \"Cython-0.17b3\\BUILD\\run\\c\\parallel\\parallel.pyd\", line ?, in parallel.__test__.test_prange (line 20)\nFailed example:\n    test_prange()\nExpected:\n    (9, 9, 45, 45)\nGot:\n    (0, 9, 45, 45)\n```\n\nThis issue was reported and discussed on the cython-devel mailing list <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/cython-devel/2012-August/003068.html>\n\nA simple example is:\n\n```\ndef test_parallel():\n    cdef int i = 0, s = 0\n    with nogil, cython.parallel.parallel():\n        for i in prange(10):\n            s += i\n    return i\n```\n\nRepeated runs of  test_parallel() return 0 or 9.\nCython translates the function body to something like this (hope I got it right):\n\n```\nint i = 0;\nint s = 0;\nlong t1;\nlong t2;\n#pragma omp parallel reduction(+:s) private(t1, t2)\n{\n    t2 = 10;\n    i = 0;  /* ! */\n    #pragma omp for firstprivate(i) lastprivate(i)\n    {\n        for (t1 = 0; t1 < t2; t1++)\n        {\n            i = t1;\n            s = s + i;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nThe variable `i` is initialized to zero a second time within the `#pragma omp parallel` block. While this looks OK, it turns out that when the `i = 0;` statement is deleted from the Cython generated C code, the example runs correctly.\n\nOn my system, this PR fixes all the lastprivate related test errors and does not have any side effects on other tests.\n\nI wonder why the private loop variables `t1` and `t2` are of C `long`, not `ssize_t` types.",
