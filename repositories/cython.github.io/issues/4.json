[Example screenshot on Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/nit9qDn).\r\n\r\nThis is undesirable from a general UX perspective and can be an issue for accessibility. Is there any reason they can't be a slightly brighter shade, and/or underlined?\r\n\r\nThey also don't change on-hover or if they've already been followed. Is there any reason not to set this?",
